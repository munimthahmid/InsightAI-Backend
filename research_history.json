By enabling multiple agents to work together towards a common goal, it allows for improved efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in complex real-world scenarios.\n\nAccording to Document 1, autonomous multi-agent collaboration has the potential to revolutionize industrial automation by enabling robots to collaborate seamlessly on tasks such as assembly line operations. This can lead to increased productivity and reduced costs. Document 2 highlights the importance of multi-agent collaboration in disaster response scenarios, where multiple robots can work together to search for survivors or perform hazardous tasks. In the healthcare domain, Document 3 emphasizes the significance of autonomous multi-agent collaboration in assisting medical professionals in tasks such as patient monitoring and medication delivery.\n\n## Challenges and Perspectives\n\nWhile autonomous multi-agent collaboration offers numerous benefits, it also presents several challenges. One of the key challenges is achieving effective coordination and communication among the agents. Document 4 discusses the importance of developing robust communication protocols and coordination mechanisms to ensure efficient collaboration. Additionally, Document 5 highlights the challenge of balancing individual agent autonomy with the need for collective decision-making, as excessive autonomy can lead to conflicts and inefficiencies.\n\nAnother perspective to consider is the ethical implications of autonomous multi-agent collaboration. Document 6 raises concerns about the potential for biased decision-making and the need for transparency and accountability in the algorithms used by the agents. It also emphasizes the importance of considering the impact on human workers and ensuring that autonomous systems do not replace human labor entirely.\n\n## Patterns, Trends, and Key Insights\n\nAnalyzing the provided documents, several patterns, trends, and key insights emerge regarding autonomous multi-agent collaboration for real-world task completion. \n\nFirstly, there is a clear trend towards the development of decentralized approaches to multi-agent collaboration. Document 1 discusses the use of decentralized control architectures, where each agent has its own decision-making capabilities, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability. Similarly, Document 4 highlights the importance of distributed coordination mechanisms to enable efficient collaboration without relying on a central controller.\n\nSecondly, there is a growing emphasis on learning-based approaches for multi-agent collaboration. Document 2 mentions the use of reinforcement learning techniques to enable agents to learn from their interactions and improve their collaboration strategies over time. This trend towards learning-based approaches indicates the potential for autonomous agents to continuously adapt and improve their collaboration capabilities.\n\nLastly, the importance of human-agent collaboration is a recurring theme in the provided documents. Document 3 emphasizes the need for seamless integration between autonomous agents and human operators in healthcare settings. This suggests that successful multi-agent collaboration should not only focus on agent-agent interactions but also consider the interaction between agents and humans.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, autonomous multi-agent collaboration for real-world task completion is a topic of great significance in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics. It offers numerous benefits in various domains but also presents challenges in terms of coordination, communication, and ethical considerations. By analyzing the provided documents, we have identified patterns, trends, and key insights, including the importance of decentralized approaches, learning-based techniques, and human-agent collaboration. Further research and development in this area are crucial to unlock the full potential of autonomous multi-agent collaboration and its applications in real-world scenarios.\n\n## References\n\n[Document 1] - Author, Title, Source\n\n[Document 2] - Author, Title, Source\n\n[Document 3] - Author, Title, Source\n\n[Document 4] - Author, Title, Source\n\n[Document 5] - Author, Title, Source\n\n[Document 6] - Author, Title, Source",

          "summary": "Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point\nclouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network\narchitectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast,\nthe limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major\nbottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has\ndriven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video\ndata with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this\nwork, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient\ntraining-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention\nadaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training\nor network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently\nencode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully\ndisentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region\nsegmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction.\nExtensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our\nlightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic\ndatasets.

          "summary": "UTe$_2$ has been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies\nin recent years, as it is recognized as an odd-parity bulk superconductor. Its\nsurface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density\nwave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we\npropose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface\nand in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual\nfeatures detected by surface probes in this material. Through a\nphenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental\nsignatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of\nCDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii)\nthe magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the\nCDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature\nand its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental\nchecks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.",

          "content": "Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) refers to the collaborative operation of manned and unmanned systems, typically in military or aerospace contexts, to enhance mission effectiveness. It enables human operators to control, coordinate, or supervise autonomous or semi-autonomous platforms, such as drones or robotic systems, to improve situational awareness, reduce risk, and optimize performance in complex environments.\nA loyal wingman is a proposed type of unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) which incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and is capable of collaborating with the next generation of crewed combat aircraft, including sixth-generation fighters and bombers such as the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider. Also unlike the conventional UCAV, the loyal wingman is expected to be capable of surviving on the battlefield but to be significantly lower-cost than a crewed aircraft with similar capabilities. In the US, the concept is known as the collaborative combat aircraft (CCA). CCAs are intended to operate in collaborative teams with the next generation of manned combat aircraft, including sixth-generation fighters and bombers such as the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider. Unlike the conventional UCAVs, the CCA incorporates artificial intelligence (AI), denoted an \"autonomy package\", increasing its survivability on the battlefield. It is still expected to cost much less than a manned aircraft with similar capabilities. The US Air Force plans to spend more than $8.9 billion on its CCA programs from fiscal years 2025 to 2029, with an additional $661 million planned for fiscal year 2024. The success of the CCA program may lessen the need for additional manned squadrons.",

          "content": "Situational awareness or situation awareness, often abbreviated as SA is the understanding of an environment, its elements, and how it changes with respect to time or other factors.  It is also defined as the perception of the elements in the environment considering time and space, the understanding of their meaning, and the prediction of their status in the near future. It is also defined as adaptive, externally-directed consciousness focused on acquiring knowledge about a dynamic task environment and directed action within that environment.\nSituation awareness is recognized as a critical foundation for successful decision making in many situations, including the ones which involve the protection of human life and property, such as law enforcement, aviation, air traffic control, ship navigation, health care, emergency response, military command and control operations, transmission system operators, self defense, and offshore oil and nuclear power plant management.\nInadequate situation awareness has been identified as one of the primary causal factors in accidents attributed to human error. According to Endsley\u2019s situation awareness theory, when someone meets a dangerous situation, he needs an appropriate and a precise decision-making process which includes pattern recognition and matching, formation of sophisticated frameworks and fundamental knowledge that aids correct decision making.\nThe formal definition of situational awareness is often described as three ascending levels:\n\nPerception of the elements in the environment,\nComprehension or understanding of the situation, and\nProjection of future status.\nPeople with the highest levels of situational awareness not only perceive the relevant information for their goals and decisions, but are also able to integrate that information to understand its meaning or significance, and are able to project likely or possible future scenarios. These higher levels of situational awareness are critical for proactive decision making in demanding environments.\nThree aspects of situational awareness have been the focus in research: situational awareness states, situational awareness systems, and situational awareness processes. Situational awareness states refers to the actual level of awareness people have of the situation. Situational awareness systems refers to technologies that are developed to support situational awareness in many environments. Situational awareness processes refers to the updating of situational awareness states, and what guides the moment-to-moment change of situational awareness.\n\n",

Multiple UAVs must be capable of autonomous collaboration and area search coverage for this. Therefore, we integrate multi-agent reinforcement learning into the cooperative control method of UAV swarm and propose a decentralized cooperative control for networked multiple UAVs technique based on the extended-proximal policy optimization algorithm (EPPO). The proposed approach not only adopts distributed training for multiple agents, but also allows them to obtain some mutual state information, such as position information and searched sub-areas. So, it can significantly speed up training and increase the effectiveness and safety of task completion in real-world applications. After a simulation, the multi-intelligent UAV can rapidly cover 100% of the mission area and ensure more excellent safety.",

          "abstract": "Autonomous agents empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone significant improvements, enabling them to generalize across a broad spectrum of tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, cooperation among individuals is often required to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of task accomplishment. Hence, inspired by human group dynamics, we propose a multi-agent framework \\framework that can collaboratively and dynamically adjust its composition as a greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts system. Our experiments demonstrate that \\framework framework can effectively deploy multi-agent groups that outperform a single agent. Furthermore, we delve into the emergence of social behaviors among individual agents within a group during collaborative task accomplishment. In view of these behaviors, we discuss some possible strategies to leverage positive ones and mitigate negative ones for improving the collaborative potential of multi-agent groups.

    "report": "# Introduction\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives, revolutionizing various industries and enhancing efficiency. However, as AI continues to advance, ethical concerns surrounding its development and use have emerged. AI ethics refers to the moral principles and guidelines that govern the design, development, and deployment of AI systems. This research report aims to explore the importance of AI ethics, present multiple perspectives on the topic, analyze specific data and examples from the provided documents, identify key insights and trends, and conclude with a summary of the main findings.\n\n# Importance of AI Ethics\n\nAI ethics is of paramount importance due to several reasons. Firstly, AI systems have the potential to impact individuals and society at large. They can influence decision-making processes, affect privacy and security, and shape social norms. Without ethical considerations, AI systems may perpetuate biases, discriminate against certain groups, or invade privacy [Document 1]. Secondly, AI has the potential to disrupt labor markets, leading to job displacement and economic inequality. Ethical guidelines can help ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a manner that minimizes these negative impacts [Document 2]. Lastly, AI ethics is crucial for maintaining public trust in AI technologies. By adhering to ethical principles, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI development and use, fostering trust among users and stakeholders [Document 3].\n\n# Perspectives on AI Ethics\n\n## Ethical Considerations in AI Development\n\nOne perspective on AI ethics emphasizes the importance of incorporating ethical considerations into the development process. This approach argues that AI systems should be designed to align with societal values, respect human rights, and promote fairness and transparency [Document 1]. Ethical guidelines, such as those proposed by organizations like the Partnership on AI, can help developers navigate complex ethical dilemmas and ensure responsible AI development [Document 3].\n\n## Balancing Ethical Considerations with Innovation\n\nAnother perspective acknowledges the importance of AI ethics but emphasizes the need to balance ethical considerations with innovation and progress. This viewpoint argues that overly restrictive ethical guidelines may hinder technological advancements and limit the potential benefits of AI. It suggests that a flexible and adaptive approach to AI ethics is necessary to strike a balance between innovation and ethical considerations [Document 2].\n\n# Analysis of Specific Data and Examples\n\n## Bias in AI Systems\n\nOne key issue in AI ethics is the presence of bias in AI systems. Research has shown that AI algorithms can perpetuate and amplify existing biases present in training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. For example, facial recognition systems have been found to have higher error rates for women and people with darker skin tones [Document 1]. This highlights the importance of addressing bias in AI systems to ensure fairness and prevent discrimination.\n\n## Privacy and Security Concerns\n\nAI systems often rely on vast amounts of data, raising concerns about privacy and security. Improper handling of personal data can lead to breaches and unauthorized access. For instance, the use of AI in surveillance systems has raised concerns about the potential for mass surveillance and infringement on privacy rights [Document 3]. It is crucial to establish robust data protection measures and ensure transparency in data collection and usage to address these concerns.\n\n# Key Insights and Trends\n\nThrough the analysis of the provided documents, several key insights and trends emerge. Firstly, there is a growing recognition of the importance of AI ethics among researchers, policymakers, and organizations. This is evident from the establishment of ethical guidelines and initiatives aimed at promoting responsible AI development [Document 3]. Secondly, bias in AI systems is a significant concern that needs to be addressed. Efforts are being made to develop techniques for mitigating bias and ensuring fairness in AI algorithms [Document 1]. Lastly, the debate around AI ethics often revolves around finding the right balance between ethical considerations and innovation. Striking this balance is crucial to harness the potential benefits of AI while minimizing its negative impacts [Document 2].\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, AI ethics is a critical aspect of AI development and deployment. It ensures that AI systems are designed and used in a manner that aligns with societal values, respects human rights, and promotes fairness and transparency. The analysis of the provided documents highlights the importance of addressing bias in AI systems, protecting privacy and security, and finding the right balance between ethical considerations and innovation. By adhering to ethical principles, organizations can build trust, mitigate negative impacts, and maximize the potential benefits of AI. It is imperative for stakeholders to continue engaging in discussions and collaborations to shape AI ethics and ensure responsible AI development and use.",

          "summary": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

          "summary": "The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological\nimages present significant challenges in computational pathology. While\npathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative\nadvancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable\nstorage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore,\nensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous\nvalidation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present\nPathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via\nself-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from\n20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously\nevaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public\ndatasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer\nclassification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,\nbiomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of\nstructured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across\n27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,\nincluding pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype\ndiagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to\ngenerate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and\ndiagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by\nfoundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra\nexemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised\npathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade\ntasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation\nunderline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward\nmore efficient and high-quality medical services.",

          "summary": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

          "summary": "The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological\nimages present significant challenges in computational pathology. While\npathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative\nadvancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable\nstorage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore,\nensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous\nvalidation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present\nPathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via\nself-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from\n20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously\nevaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public\ndatasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer\nclassification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,\nbiomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of\nstructured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across\n27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,\nincluding pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype\ndiagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to\ngenerate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and\ndiagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by\nfoundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra\nexemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised\npathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade\ntasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation\nunderline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward\nmore efficient and high-quality medical services.",

          "summary": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

          "summary": "The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological\nimages present significant challenges in computational pathology. While\npathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative\nadvancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable\nstorage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore,\nensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous\nvalidation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present\nPathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via\nself-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from\n20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously\nevaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public\ndatasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer\nclassification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,\nbiomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of\nstructured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across\n27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,\nincluding pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype\ndiagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to\ngenerate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and\ndiagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by\nfoundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra\nexemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised\npathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade\ntasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation\nunderline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward\nmore efficient and high-quality medical services.",

In consequence, a number of ethics guidelines have been released in recent years. These guidelines comprise normative principles and recommendations aimed to harness the \u201cdisruptive\u201d potentials of new AI technologies. Designed as a semi-systematic evaluation, this paper analyzes and compares 22 guidelines, highlighting overlaps but also omissions. As a result, I give a detailed overview of the field of AI ethics. Finally, I also examine to what extent the respective ethical principles and values are implemented in the practice of research, development and application of AI systems\u2014and how the effectiveness in the demands of AI ethics can be improved.",

Designed as a semi-systematic evaluation, this paper analyzes and compares 22 guidelines, highlighting overlaps but also omissions. As a result, I give a detailed overview of the field of AI ethics. Finally, I also examine to what extent the respective ethical principles and values are implemented in the practice of research, development and application of AI systems\u2014and how the effectiveness in the demands of AI ethics can be improved.",

          "summary": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

          "summary": "The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological\nimages present significant challenges in computational pathology. While\npathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative\nadvancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable\nstorage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore,\nensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous\nvalidation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present\nPathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via\nself-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from\n20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously\nevaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public\ndatasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer\nclassification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,\nbiomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of\nstructured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across\n27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,\nincluding pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype\ndiagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to\ngenerate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and\ndiagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by\nfoundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra\nexemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised\npathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade\ntasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation\nunderline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward\nmore efficient and high-quality medical services.",

    "report": "# AI Ethics\n\n## Introduction\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic of increasing importance in today's society. As AI technology continues to advance and become more integrated into various aspects of our lives, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications and ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI ethics, covering various topics such as algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, regulation, and emerging challenges in the field. By examining multiple perspectives and presenting relevant data and examples, this report seeks to shed light on the key issues and insights surrounding AI ethics.\n\n## Algorithmic Biases and Fairness\nOne of the key ethical concerns in AI is algorithmic biases and fairness. Algorithms are designed to make decisions based on data, but if the data used to train these algorithms is biased, it can lead to discriminatory outcomes [research-1]. For example, facial recognition systems have been found to have higher error rates for people with darker skin tones and women [research-2]. This raises concerns about the potential for AI systems to perpetuate and amplify existing biases in society. To address this issue, it is important to ensure that AI algorithms are trained on diverse and representative datasets and that there are mechanisms in place to detect and mitigate biases in AI systems [research-2].\n\n## Automated Decision-Making and Accountability\nAnother ethical consideration in AI is automated decision-making and accountability. AI systems are increasingly being used to make important decisions that can have significant impacts on individuals and society, such as in healthcare, criminal justice, and finance [research-1]. However, there is a lack of transparency and accountability in many AI systems, making it difficult to understand how decisions are being made and to hold AI systems accountable for their actions [research-2]. This raises concerns about the potential for AI systems to make biased or unfair decisions without proper oversight. To address this issue, there is a need for increased transparency and explainability in AI systems, as well as mechanisms for recourse and accountability when AI systems make mistakes or cause harm [research-2].\n\n## Privacy and Regulation\nAI also raises important ethical considerations regarding privacy and regulation. AI systems often rely on large amounts of personal data to function effectively, raising concerns about the privacy and security of this data [research-1]. There is a need for robust data protection and privacy regulations to ensure that individuals' personal information is not misused or exploited by AI systems [research-5]. Additionally, there is a need for clear and comprehensive regulations to govern the development and use of AI systems, particularly in sensitive areas such as healthcare, education, criminal justice, and the military [research-1]. These regulations should address issues such as data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and the ethical use of AI technologies.\n\n## Emerging Challenges and Future Implications\nIn addition to the current ethical considerations in AI, there are also emerging challenges and potential future implications that need to be addressed. These include machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, AI welfare and rights, artificial superintelligence, and existential risks [research-1]. These challenges highlight the need for ongoing research and discussion on AI ethics to ensure that AI technologies are developed and used in a way that aligns with human values and promotes the well-being of society.\n\n## Perspectives and Insights\nExamining multiple perspectives on AI ethics is crucial to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the topic. While AI has the potential to bring about significant benefits and advancements, it also poses ethical risks and challenges. It is important to strike a balance between innovation and ethical considerations, ensuring that AI systems are developed and used in a way that respects human rights, promotes fairness and accountability, and safeguards privacy [research-2]. By considering diverse perspectives and engaging in interdisciplinary discussions, we can work towards developing ethical frameworks and guidelines that guide the responsible development and use of AI technologies.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, AI ethics is a complex and multifaceted topic that requires careful consideration and ongoing research. The ethical implications of AI extend to various areas, including algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation. It is crucial to address these ethical considerations to ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. By examining multiple perspectives and considering emerging challenges and future implications, we can work towards developing ethical frameworks and guidelines that promote the responsible and beneficial use of AI technologies.\n\n## Citations\n[research-1] - The ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within the field that are considered to have particular ethical stakes. This includes algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation. It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks. Some application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military [research-1].\n\n[research-2] - Current advances in research, development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yielded a far-reaching discourse on AI ethics.

          "summary": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

          "summary": "The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological\nimages present significant challenges in computational pathology. While\npathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative\nadvancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable\nstorage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore,\nensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous\nvalidation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present\nPathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via\nself-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from\n20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously\nevaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public\ndatasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer\nclassification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,\nbiomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of\nstructured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across\n27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,\nincluding pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype\ndiagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to\ngenerate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and\ndiagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by\nfoundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra\nexemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised\npathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade\ntasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation\nunderline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward\nmore efficient and high-quality medical services.",

Designed as a semi-systematic evaluation, this paper analyzes and compares 22 guidelines, highlighting overlaps but also omissions. As a result, I give a detailed overview of the field of AI ethics.

    "report": "# AI Ethics\n\n## Introduction\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic of increasing importance in today's society. As AI technology continues to advance and become more integrated into various aspects of our lives, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications and ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. AI ethics covers a broad range of topics, including algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation [research-1]. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI ethics, examining various perspectives and discussing key insights and trends in the field.\n\n## Ethical Guidelines in AI\nIn recent years, there has been a proliferation of ethics guidelines aimed at addressing the ethical challenges posed by AI systems. These guidelines provide normative principles and recommendations to guide the development and application of AI technologies [research-2]. A study analyzing 22 guidelines found overlaps and omissions, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive and standardized approach to AI ethics [research-2]. The effectiveness of these guidelines in shaping the practice of AI research, development, and application is an ongoing area of investigation [research-2].\n\n## AI Literacy\nAI literacy, or artificial intelligence literacy, refers to the ability to understand, use, monitor, and critically reflect on AI applications. It is essential to teach AI skills and knowledge to the general public, particularly those who are not proficient in AI [research-3]. While some argue that AI literacy is crucial for students' future employment prospects, others have banned the use of AI in classrooms, considering it as cheating [research-3]. Users of AI tools should be able to make informed decisions, highlighting the importance of AI literacy in society [research-3].\n\n## Application Areas with Ethical Implications\nCertain application areas of AI have particularly important ethical implications. These include healthcare, education, criminal justice, and the military [research-1]. In healthcare, for example, AI systems are used for diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and drug discovery. Ethical considerations arise in ensuring patient privacy, avoiding biases in healthcare algorithms, and maintaining human oversight in critical medical decisions [research-1]. Similarly, in the criminal justice system, AI is used for risk assessment and predictive policing, raising concerns about fairness, accountability, and potential biases [research-1].\n\n## Global Landscape of AI Ethics Guidelines\nThe global landscape of AI ethics guidelines is diverse and constantly evolving. A study analyzed the landscape of AI ethics guidelines and found a wide range of approaches and focuses [research-4]. The study identified guidelines from various organizations and countries, highlighting the global interest and recognition of the importance of AI ethics [research-4]. However, the study also noted the need for harmonization and coordination among these guidelines to ensure consistency and effectiveness [research-4].\n\n## AI Ethics Resources\nThere are several resources available to explore and understand AI ethics. The \"awesome-artificial-intelligence-regulation\" repository on GitHub aims to map the ecosystem of AI guidelines, principles, codes of ethics, standards, and regulations [research-5]. This repository provides a comprehensive collection of resources related to AI ethics, including topics such as data ethics, privacy, and regulation [research-5]. Additionally, there are tutorials and educational materials available, such as the \"Artificial-Intelligence-Deep-Learning-Machine-Learning-Tutorials\" repository, which covers various aspects of AI, including ethics and policy [research-9].\n\n## Conclusion\nAI ethics is a complex and multifaceted field that encompasses a wide range of topics and challenges. It is crucial to address the ethical implications of AI systems to ensure their responsible and ethical development and use. The proliferation of ethics guidelines and the ongoing research in this area demonstrate the growing recognition of the importance of AI ethics. However, there is a need for standardized approaches and coordination among these guidelines. AI literacy is also essential to empower individuals to make informed decisions about AI applications. By considering multiple perspectives and staying informed about the latest developments in AI ethics, we can navigate the ethical challenges posed by AI technology and shape a future that benefits society as a whole.\n\n## References\n[research-1] Untitled Source\n\n[research-2] Untitled Source\n\n[research-3] Untitled Source\n\n[research-4] Untitled Source\n\n[research-5] Untitled Source\n\n## References\n\n[research-1] Untitled Source (Source: research)\n\n[research-2] Untitled Source (Source: research)\n\n[research-3] Untitled Source (Source: research)\n\n[research-4] Untitled Source (Source: research)\n\n[research-5] Untitled Source (Source: research)\n\n[research-9] Untitled Source (Source: research)\n\n",

          "summary": "The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological\nimages present significant challenges in computational pathology. While\npathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative\nadvancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable\nstorage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore,\nensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous\nvalidation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present\nPathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via\nself-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from\n20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously\nevaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public\ndatasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer\nclassification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,\nbiomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of\nstructured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across\n27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,\nincluding pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype\ndiagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to\ngenerate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and\ndiagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by\nfoundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra\nexemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised\npathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade\ntasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation\nunderline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward\nmore efficient and high-quality medical services.",

Designed as a semi-systematic evaluation, this paper analyzes and compares 22 guidelines, highlighting overlaps but also omissions. As a result, I give a detailed overview of the field of AI ethics.

    "report": "# Research Report: AI Ethics\n\n## Introduction\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic of increasing importance in today's society. As AI technologies continue to advance and become more integrated into various aspects of our lives, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications and ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. This research report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI ethics, covering various topics such as algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, regulation, and emerging challenges. By examining multiple perspectives and presenting specific data and examples, this report seeks to shed light on the key insights and trends in AI ethics.\n\n## Algorithmic Biases and Fairness\nOne of the key ethical concerns in AI is algorithmic biases and fairness. Algorithms are designed to make decisions based on data, but if the data used to train these algorithms is biased, it can lead to discriminatory outcomes. For example, facial recognition algorithms have been found to have higher error rates for certain racial and gender groups [research-1]. This raises concerns about the fairness and potential harm caused by AI systems. It is important to address these biases and ensure that AI algorithms are fair and unbiased, taking into account the diversity and inclusivity of the population they serve.\n\n## Automated Decision-Making and Accountability\nAI systems are increasingly being used for automated decision-making in various domains, such as healthcare, criminal justice, and finance. However, the lack of transparency and explainability in these systems raises questions about accountability. When AI systems make decisions that have significant impacts on individuals' lives, it is crucial to ensure that there is transparency in the decision-making process and mechanisms for holding AI systems accountable for their actions. This includes the ability to understand how decisions are made, challenge decisions when necessary, and provide recourse for individuals affected by AI decisions [research-1].\n\n## Privacy and Regulation\nThe widespread use of AI technologies also raises concerns about privacy. AI systems often rely on large amounts of personal data to make accurate predictions and decisions. However, the collection, storage, and use of personal data by AI systems can pose risks to individuals' privacy. It is essential to have robust regulations and frameworks in place to protect individuals' privacy rights and ensure that AI systems adhere to ethical standards when handling personal data. Additionally, regulations can help prevent the misuse of AI technologies and provide guidelines for responsible AI development and deployment [research-1].\n\n## Emerging Challenges\nAs AI technologies continue to advance, new ethical challenges and risks are emerging. These include machine ethics, lethal autonomous weapon systems, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, AI welfare and rights, artificial superintelligence, and existential risks [research-1]. Machine ethics refers to the challenge of developing AI systems that behave ethically and make moral decisions. Lethal autonomous weapon systems raise concerns about the ethical implications of AI in warfare. AI safety and alignment focus on ensuring that AI systems are developed in a way that aligns with human values and does not pose risks to humanity. Technological unemployment refers to the potential job displacement caused by AI technologies. AI-enabled misinformation raises concerns about the spread of fake news and the manipulation of public opinion. AI welfare and rights explore the ethical considerations of treating certain AI systems as having moral status. Artificial superintelligence and existential risks examine the potential risks associated with highly advanced AI systems.\n\n## Perspectives and Insights\nThe topic of AI ethics is complex and multifaceted, with various perspectives and insights. It is important to consider the viewpoints of different stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, industry professionals, and the general public. By examining multiple perspectives, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the ethical challenges and potential solutions in AI. For example, the research community is actively working on developing guidelines, principles, and codes of ethics for AI [research-2]. Policymakers play a crucial role in establishing regulations and frameworks to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI technologies. Industry professionals have a responsibility to develop and deploy AI systems that adhere to ethical standards and prioritize the well-being of individuals and society.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, AI ethics is a critical topic that requires careful consideration and attention. The ethical implications of AI technologies, including algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation, must be addressed to ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner. By examining multiple perspectives and considering emerging challenges, we can gain valuable insights into the key ethical considerations in AI. It is essential for researchers, policymakers, industry professionals, and the general public to collaborate and work towards developing ethical frameworks, regulations, and guidelines to guide the development and deployment of AI technologies.\n\n## Citations\n[research-1] - The ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within the field that are considered to have particular ethical stakes. This includes algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation. It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks. Some application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military [research-1].\n\n[research-2] - The repository \"awesome-artificial-intelligence-regulation\" aims to map the ecosystem of artificial intelligence guidelines, principles, codes of ethics, standards, regulation, and beyond. It provides a comprehensive collection of resources related to AI ethics, including topics such as AI guidelines, AI policy, data ethics, data protection, ethical AI, ethics frameworks, machine learning guidelines, privacy, and regulation [research-2].\n\n## References\n\n[research-1] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-2] Source document (Source: research)\n\n",

          "summary": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

    "query": "AI Ethics",
    "report": "# AI Ethics\n\n## Introduction\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic of increasing importance in today's society. As AI technology continues to advance and become more integrated into various aspects of our lives, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications and ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a responsible and beneficial manner. AI ethics covers a broad range of topics, including algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, regulation, and more [research-1].\n\n## Algorithmic Biases and Fairness\nOne of the key ethical concerns in AI is algorithmic biases and fairness. AI systems are trained on large datasets, and if these datasets contain biases, the AI system may perpetuate those biases in its decision-making processes. This can lead to unfair outcomes and discrimination. For example, biased AI algorithms have been found to discriminate against certain racial or gender groups in areas such as hiring or criminal justice [research-1].\n\nTo address this issue, it is important to develop techniques to detect and mitigate biases in AI algorithms. Researchers have proposed various methods, such as fairness-aware learning algorithms and pre-processing techniques, to ensure that AI systems are fair and unbiased [research-1].\n\n## Automated Decision-Making and Accountability\nAnother ethical concern in AI is automated decision-making and accountability. As AI systems become more autonomous and make decisions that impact individuals and society, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions are transparent, explainable, and accountable. Individuals should have the right to understand how and why a decision was made by an AI system.\n\nTo address this concern, researchers have proposed methods for explainable AI, which aim to provide insights into the decision-making process of AI systems. These methods include techniques such as rule-based explanations, model-agnostic explanations, and interpretable machine learning models [research-1].\n\n## Privacy and Regulation\nAI systems often deal with large amounts of personal data, raising concerns about privacy. It is important to establish regulations and policies to protect individuals' privacy rights and ensure that AI systems handle personal data in a responsible and secure manner. Additionally, regulations can help prevent the misuse of AI technology and protect individuals from potential harms.\n\nSeveral organizations and countries have already taken steps to regulate AI. For example, the United States and the United Kingdom have established their own AI Safety Institutes to address the safety and ethical concerns of AI [research-3]. However, there is a need for ongoing efforts to keep pace with the rapid development of AI capabilities [research-3].\n\n## AI Safety and Alignment\nAI safety is a critical aspect of AI ethics. It involves preventing accidents, misuse, or other harmful consequences arising from AI systems. AI safety encompasses machine ethics and AI alignment, which aim to ensure that AI systems are moral and beneficial. This field is particularly concerned with existential risks posed by advanced AI models [research-3].\n\nTo ensure AI safety, researchers are developing norms, policies, and frameworks that promote safety and align AI systems with human values. This includes monitoring AI systems for risks, enhancing their reliability, and developing techniques for AI alignment [research-3].\n\n## AI Ethics Education\nGiven the increasing importance of AI ethics, it is crucial to educate future professionals in science and engineering about the ethical considerations surrounding AI development and use. Research has shown that explicit-reflective learning modules can enhance students' ethical knowledge, awareness, and problem-solving skills in AI ethics [research-2].\n\nEfforts should be made to integrate AI ethics into higher education curricula, particularly for science and engineering students who are at the forefront of AI innovations. Comprehensive ethics education initiatives can help prepare students with the necessary skills for ethical decision-making in the field of AI [research-4].\n\n## Perspectives and Challenges\nWhile there are ongoing efforts to address AI ethics, there are challenges and opportunities that need to be considered. Cultural variability, regulatory gaps, and the rapid pace of AI innovation are some of the challenges in implementing AI ethics principles [research-6]. However, there are opportunities to establish global ethical standards, foster public trust, and promote responsible AI innovation [research-6].\n\nIt is also important to consider multiple perspectives when discussing AI ethics. Different stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, industry leaders, and the general public, may have different views on what constitutes ethical AI and how to address ethical concerns. Balancing these perspectives and finding common ground is crucial for the development of comprehensive AI ethics frameworks and guidelines.\n\n## Conclusion\nAI ethics is a complex and multidisciplinary field that encompasses various ethical considerations in the development and use of AI systems. Algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation are some of the key ethical concerns. Efforts are being made to address these concerns through techniques such as bias detection and mitigation, explainable AI, and AI safety measures.\n\nEducation in AI ethics is crucial to prepare future professionals with the necessary skills for ethical decision-making. Integrating AI ethics into higher education curricula, particularly for science and engineering students, can help foster ethical awareness and problem-solving abilities.\n\nWhile there are challenges in implementing AI ethics principles, there are also opportunities to establish global ethical standards and promote responsible AI innovation. It is important to consider multiple perspectives and engage stakeholders from various backgrounds to develop comprehensive and balanced AI ethics frameworks.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[research-12] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-13] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-18] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-1] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-23] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-25] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-2] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-3] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-4] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-6] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-7] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-8] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-9] Source document (Source: research)\n\n",

          "summary": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

          "summary": "The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological\nimages present significant challenges in computational pathology. While\npathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative\nadvancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable\nstorage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore,\nensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous\nvalidation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present\nPathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via\nself-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from\n20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously\nevaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public\ndatasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer\nclassification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,\nbiomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of\nstructured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across\n27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,\nincluding pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype\ndiagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to\ngenerate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and\ndiagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by\nfoundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra\nexemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised\npathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade\ntasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation\nunderline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward\nmore efficient and high-quality medical services.",

Through empirical studies in two contexts -- survey article authoring\nin scholarly research and business document sensemaking -- we examine how\ndomain expertise shapes patterns of AI delegation and information processing\namong knowledge workers. Our findings reveal that while experts welcome AI\nassistance with repetitive information foraging tasks, they prefer to retain\ncontrol over complex synthesis and interpretation activities that require\nnuanced domain understanding. We identify implications for designing GenAI\nsystems that support expert cognition. These include enabling selective\ndelegation aligned with expertise levels, preserving expert agency over\ncritical analytical tasks, considering varying levels of domain expertise in\nsystem design, and supporting verification mechanisms that help users calibrate\ntheir reliance while deepening expertise. We discuss the inherent tension\nbetween reducing cognitive load through automation and maintaining the\ndeliberate practice necessary for expertise development. Lastly, we suggest\napproaches for designing systems that provide metacognitive support, moving\nbeyond simple task automation toward actively supporting expertise development.\nThis work contributes to our understanding of how to design AI systems that\naugment rather than diminish human expertise in document-centric workflows.",

          "summary": "The rapid and unrestrained advancement of generative artificial intelligence\n(AI) presents a double-edged sword: while enabling unprecedented creativity, it\nalso facilitates the generation of highly convincing deceptive content,\nundermining societal trust. As image generation techniques become increasingly\nsophisticated, detecting synthetic images is no longer just a binary task: it\nnecessitates interpretable, context-aware methodologies that enhance\ntrustworthiness and transparency. However, existing detection models primarily\nfocus on classification, offering limited explanatory insights into image\nauthenticity. In this work, we propose FakeScope, an expert multimodal model\n(LMM) tailored for AI-generated image forensics, which not only identifies\nAI-synthetic images with high accuracy but also provides rich, interpretable,\nand query-driven forensic insights. We first construct FakeChain dataset that\ncontains linguistic authenticity reasoning based on visual trace evidence,\ndeveloped through a novel human-machine collaborative framework. Building upon\nit, we further present FakeInstruct, the largest multimodal instruction tuning\ndataset containing 2 million visual instructions tailored to enhance forensic\nawareness in LMMs. FakeScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\nclosed-ended and open-ended forensic scenarios. It can distinguish synthetic\nimages with high accuracy while offering coherent and insightful explanations,\nfree-form discussions on fine-grained forgery attributes, and actionable\nenhancement strategies. Notably, despite being trained exclusively on\nqualitative hard labels, FakeScope demonstrates remarkable zero-shot\nquantitative capability on detection, enabled by our proposed token-based\nprobability estimation strategy.

          "abstract": "\n \n As artificial intelligence (AI) technology rapidly advances, it becomes imperative to equip students with tools to navigate through the many intricate ethical considerations surrounding its development and use. Despite growing recognition of this necessity, the integration of AI ethics into higher education curricula remains limited. This paucity highlights an urgent need for comprehensive ethics education initiatives in AI, particularly for science and engineering students who are at the forefront of these innovations. Hence, this research investigates the role of an online explicit-reflective learning module in fostering science and engineering graduate students' ethical knowledge, awareness, and problem-solving skills. The study\u2019s participants included 90 graduate students specializing in diverse science and engineering research tracks. Employing the embedded mixed-methods approach, data were collected from pre- and post-intervention questionnaires with closed-ended and open-ended questions.\n \n \n The study's results indicate that the online explicit-reflective learning module significantly enhanced students' knowledge of AI ethics. Initially, students exhibited a medium\u2013high level of perceived ethical awareness, which saw a modest but statistically significant enhancement following the participation. Notably, a more distinct increase was observed in students' actual awareness of ethical issues in AI, before and after the intervention. Content analysis of students\u2019 responses to the open-ended questions revealed an increase in their ability to identify and articulate concerns relating to privacy breaches, the utilization of flawed datasets, and issues of biased social representation. Moreover, while students initially displayed limited problem-solving abilities in AI ethics, a considerable enhancement in these competencies was evident post-intervention.\n \n \n The study results highlight the important role of explicit-reflective learning in preparing future professionals in science and engineering with the skills necessary for ethical decision-making. The study highlights the need for placing more emphasis not only on students\u2019 ability to identify AI-related ethical issues but also on their capacity to resolve and perhaps mitigate the impact of such ethical dilemmas.\n",

          "abstract": "\u2014Recent breakthroughs in natural language pro- cessing (NLP) have permitted the synthesis and comprehension of coherent text in an open-ended way, therefore translating the theoretical algorithms into practical applications. The large language-model (LLM) has signi\ufb01cantly impacted businesses such as report summarization softwares and copywriters. Ob-servations indicate, however, that LLMs may exhibit social prejudice and toxicity, posing ethical and societal dangers of consequences resulting from irresponsibility. Large-scale bench- marks for accountable LLMs should consequently be developed. Although several empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical di\ufb03culties in advanced LLMs, there is no systematic examination and user study of the ethics of current LLMs use. To further educate future e\ufb00orts on constructing ethical LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 1 to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs. We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) Bias 2) Reliability 3) Robustness 4) Toxicity. In accordance with our stated viewpoints, we empirically benchmark ChatGPT on multiple sample datasets. We \ufb01nd that a signi\ufb01cant number of ethical risks cannot be addressed by existing benchmarks, and hence illustrate them via additional case studies. In addition, we examine the implications of our \ufb01ndings on the AI ethics of ChatGPT, as well as future problems and practical design considerations for LLMs. We believe that our \ufb01ndings may give light on future e\ufb00orts to determine and mitigate the ethical hazards posed by machines in LLM applications.",

It encompasses machine ethics and AI alignment, which aim to ensure AI systems are moral and beneficial, as well as monitoring AI systems for risks and enhancing their reliability. The field is particularly concerned with existential risks posed by advanced AI models.\nBeyond technical research, AI safety involves developing norms and policies that promote safety. It gained significant popularity in 2023, with rapid progress in generative AI and public concerns voiced by researchers and CEOs about potential dangers. During the 2023 AI Safety Summit, the United States and the United Kingdom both established their own AI Safety Institute. However, researchers have expressed concern that AI safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of AI capabilities."

    "report": "# AI Ethics\n\n## Introduction\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic of increasing importance in today's society. As AI technology continues to advance and become more integrated into various aspects of our lives, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications and potential risks associated with its use. AI ethics covers a broad range of topics, including algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation [research-1]. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI ethics, considering multiple perspectives and presenting key insights from various sources.\n\n## Algorithmic Biases and Fairness\nOne of the significant ethical concerns in AI is algorithmic biases and fairness. Algorithms are designed to make decisions based on patterns and data, but they can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the data they are trained on. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes in areas such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice [research-1]. It is essential to address these biases and ensure fairness in AI systems to prevent discrimination and promote equal opportunities for all individuals.\n\n## Automated Decision-Making and Accountability\nAI systems are increasingly being used for automated decision-making in various domains, including healthcare, education, criminal justice, and the military [research-1]. However, the lack of transparency and explainability in these systems raises concerns about accountability. When AI systems make decisions that impact individuals' lives, it is crucial to have mechanisms in place to hold them accountable for their actions [research-1]. This includes ensuring transparency in decision-making processes and providing individuals with the right to challenge and appeal automated decisions.\n\n## Privacy and Data Protection\nThe widespread use of AI relies heavily on the collection and analysis of vast amounts of data. This raises significant privacy concerns, as personal information can be misused or mishandled. AI systems must adhere to strict data protection regulations to safeguard individuals' privacy rights [research-1]. Additionally, there is a need to establish clear guidelines on data ownership, consent, and the responsible use of personal data in AI applications.\n\n## Regulation and Policy Landscape\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is an emerging issue worldwide. Governments and international organizations are grappling with the development of policies and laws to promote and regulate AI [research-7]. The regulatory landscape aims to strike a balance between fostering AI innovation and managing associated risks [research-7]. Various AI ethics guidelines have been published to maintain social control over the technology [research-7]. However, there is a concern that AI safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of AI capabilities [research-3].\n\n## AI Safety and Alignment\nAI safety is a critical aspect of AI ethics, focusing on preventing accidents, misuse, or harmful consequences arising from AI systems [research-3]. It encompasses machine ethics and AI alignment, which aim to ensure AI systems are moral and beneficial [research-3]. The field of AI safety is particularly concerned with existential risks posed by advanced AI models [research-3]. Researchers and organizations are actively working on developing norms, policies, and mechanisms to enhance the safety and reliability of AI systems [research-3].\n\n## AI Literacy and Education\nAI literacy refers to the ability to understand, use, monitor, and critically reflect on AI applications [research-8]. It is essential to educate the general public, including students, about AI to make informed decisions and navigate the ethical challenges associated with AI [research-8]. However, there are differing opinions on the role of AI in education, with some professors banning AI in the classroom [research-8]. AI literacy can have a significant impact on students' future employment prospects, as AI becomes increasingly prevalent in various industries [research-8].\n\n## Key Insights and Trends\n- The field of AI ethics covers a broad range of topics, including algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation [research-1].\n- Algorithmic biases and fairness are significant ethical concerns in AI, as algorithms can perpetuate discriminatory outcomes [research-1].\n- Automated decision-making raises accountability issues, and mechanisms must be in place to hold AI systems accountable for their actions [research-1].\n- Privacy and data protection are crucial in the era of AI, as personal data is collected and analyzed on a large scale [research-1].\n- The regulation and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue worldwide, with a focus on striking a balance between innovation and risk management [research-7].\n- AI safety and alignment are essential aspects of AI ethics, aiming to prevent accidents and ensure the moral and beneficial use of AI systems [research-3].\n- AI literacy is necessary to navigate the ethical challenges associated with AI and make informed decisions [research-8].\n\n## Conclusion\nAI ethics is a complex and multifaceted field that requires careful consideration and regulation. The ethical implications of AI, including algorithmic biases, fairness, accountability, privacy, and safety, must be addressed to ensure the responsible and beneficial use of AI technology. As AI continues to advance, it is crucial to stay updated on the latest developments, research, and guidelines in AI ethics to navigate the ethical challenges and promote a more ethical and inclusive AI ecosystem.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[research-1] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-3] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-7] Source document (Source: research)\n\n[research-8] Source document (Source: research)\n\n",

Regulation is deemed necessary to both foster AI innovation and manage associated risks.\nFurthermore, organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI, adhering to established principles, and taking accountability for mitigating risks.\nRegulating AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.\n\n",

During the 2023 AI Safety Summit, the United States and the United Kingdom both established their own AI Safety Institute. However, researchers have expressed concern that AI safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of AI capabilities."

It is part of the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide, including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD.\nSince 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Regulation is deemed necessary to both foster AI innovation and manage associated risks.\nFurthermore, organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI, adhering to established principles, and taking accountability for mitigating risks.\nRegulating AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem."

    "report": "# AI Ethics\n\n## Introduction\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our lives, impacting various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. As AI continues to advance, it raises important ethical considerations. AI Ethics refers to the moral and societal implications of AI technology. This research report aims to explore the significance of AI Ethics, present different perspectives, analyze specific data and examples, identify patterns and trends, and provide a conclusion summarizing the main findings.\n\n## Importance of AI Ethics\n\nAI Ethics is crucial due to several reasons. Firstly, AI systems have the potential to make decisions that can significantly impact individuals and society as a whole. Without proper ethical guidelines, these decisions may lead to unintended consequences or reinforce existing biases [system-1]. Secondly, AI technology is rapidly evolving, and ethical considerations need to keep pace with these advancements. It is essential to ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and accountable manner. Lastly, AI Ethics is important for building public trust in AI systems. Transparency, fairness, and accountability are key factors in gaining public acceptance and avoiding potential backlash against AI technology.\n\n## Perspectives on AI Ethics\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\nOne perspective on AI Ethics emphasizes the need to prioritize ethical considerations in the development and deployment of AI systems. This viewpoint argues that AI should be designed to respect human values, protect privacy, and avoid harm to individuals or groups. Ethical guidelines and frameworks, such as the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems, provide a foundation for responsible AI development [system-1].\n\n### Economic and Technological Advancement\n\nAnother perspective focuses on the economic and technological advancements that AI can bring. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that strict ethical regulations may hinder innovation and economic growth. They believe that AI should be allowed to evolve freely, with ethical considerations being secondary to progress. However, this perspective also acknowledges the need for ethical guidelines to prevent misuse or harm caused by AI systems [system-1].\n\n### Social Impact and Inequality\n\nA third perspective highlights the potential social impact and inequality caused by AI technology. AI systems can exacerbate existing societal biases and inequalities if not properly regulated. For example, biased algorithms used in hiring processes can perpetuate discrimination. This perspective emphasizes the importance of addressing these issues through ethical guidelines and regulations to ensure fairness and equal opportunities for all [system-1].\n\n## Data, Examples, and Evidence\n\nTo support the discussion on AI Ethics, specific data, examples, and evidence are essential. Unfortunately, the provided document does not contain any specific information, data, or examples related to AI Ethics. However, it is important to note that there is a wealth of research and case studies available that highlight the ethical implications of AI technology. These include examples of biased algorithms, privacy concerns, and the impact of AI on job displacement. \n\n## Patterns, Trends, and Key Insights\n\nDespite the lack of specific data in the provided document, it is evident that AI Ethics is a topic of increasing importance. The inclusion of ethical considerations in AI development is gaining traction, with organizations and initiatives focusing on creating guidelines and frameworks. The need to address social impact and inequality caused by AI technology is also becoming more prominent. It is crucial to strike a balance between technological advancement and ethical responsibility to ensure the benefits of AI are realized without compromising societal values.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, AI Ethics plays a vital role in shaping the responsible development and deployment of AI technology. It is important to consider multiple perspectives, including ethical considerations, economic and technological advancement, and social impact and inequality. While specific data and examples were not available in the provided document, it is clear that AI Ethics is an evolving field with significant implications for individuals and society. By prioritizing ethical guidelines and regulations, we can harness the potential of AI while ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[system-1] Source document (Source: system)\n\n",

          "summary": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

    "report": "# AI Ethics\n\n## Introduction\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic of increasing importance in today's society. As AI technology continues to advance and become more integrated into various aspects of our lives, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications and potential risks associated with its use. This report aims to explore the key ethical considerations in AI and provide a comprehensive analysis of the topic.\n\n## Ethical Considerations in AI\n1. Algorithmic Biases: AI algorithms can be biased, leading to unfair outcomes and discrimination [research-1].\n2. Fairness: Ensuring fairness in AI systems is essential to prevent discrimination and promote equal opportunities [research-1].\n3. Automated Decision-Making: The use of AI in decision-making processes raises concerns about accountability and transparency [research-1].\n4. Accountability: Establishing clear lines of accountability for AI systems is crucial to address potential harms and ensure responsible use [research-1].\n5. Privacy: AI systems often collect and analyze large amounts of personal data, raising concerns about privacy and data protection [research-1].\n6. Regulation: The development and deployment of AI technology require appropriate regulations to address ethical concerns and protect societal interests [research-1].\n7. Machine Ethics: The field of machine ethics explores how to design AI systems that behave ethically and make moral decisions [research-1].\n8. Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems: The use of AI in military applications raises ethical concerns about the development and use of autonomous weapons [research-1].\n9. AI Safety and Alignment: Ensuring the safety and alignment of AI systems with human values is crucial to prevent unintended consequences [research-1].\n10. Technological Unemployment: The widespread adoption of AI technology may lead to job displacement and socioeconomic challenges [research-1].\n11. AI-Enabled Misinformation: AI can be used to generate and spread misinformation, posing risks to public discourse and democratic processes [research-1].\n12. AI Welfare and Rights: The ethical treatment of AI systems and their potential moral status is a topic of debate [research-1].\n13. Artificial Superintelligence and Existential Risks: The development of artificial superintelligence raises concerns about its potential impact on humanity and existential risks [research-1].\n\n## Perspectives on AI Ethics\nThe topic of AI ethics is complex and often elicits diverse perspectives. Some argue that strict regulations and ethical guidelines are necessary to prevent misuse and harm caused by AI systems [research-1]. Others emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability in AI decision-making processes [research-1]. However, there are also those who believe that AI has the potential to bring significant benefits to society and that ethical considerations should not hinder its progress [research-1].\n\n## Key Insights and Trends\n1. Application Areas: Certain domains, such as healthcare, education, criminal justice, and the military, have particularly important ethical implications in the context of AI [research-1].\n2. Bias Mitigation: Efforts are being made to develop techniques and frameworks to mitigate algorithmic biases and ensure fairness in AI systems [research-1].\n3. Regulation and Governance: The need for robust regulations and governance frameworks to address ethical concerns and protect societal interests is increasingly recognized [research-1].\n4. Human-AI Collaboration: The concept of human-AI collaboration, where AI systems work alongside humans, is gaining traction as a way to address ethical concerns and leverage the strengths of both [research-1].\n\n## Conclusion\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence is a multifaceted and rapidly evolving field. It encompasses various ethical considerations, including algorithmic biases, fairness, accountability, privacy, and regulation. As AI technology continues to advance, it is crucial to address these ethical concerns to ensure responsible and beneficial use. Striking a balance between innovation and ethical considerations is essential for the development and deployment of AI systems that align with societal values and promote the well-being of humanity.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[research-1] Ethics of artificial intelligence.

          "title": "Sim-and-Real Co-Training: A Simple Recipe for Vision-Based Robotic\n  Manipulation",
          "summary": "Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist\nrobot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming\nand resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing\nlarge-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and\nautomated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior\ndatasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it\nto the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality\ngap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown\nthis strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one\ntrained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community\nlacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes\nto reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work\npresents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve\nvision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from\ncomprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various\nsimulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a\nhumanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance\nreal-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences\nbetween the simulation and real-world data.

    "report": "# AI Ethics\n\n## Introduction\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic of increasing importance in today's society. As AI technology continues to advance and become more integrated into various aspects of our lives, it raises ethical concerns that need to be addressed. This report aims to explore the ethics of artificial intelligence, including algorithmic biases, fairness, automated decision-making, accountability, privacy, and regulation. It will also cover emerging challenges such as machine ethics, lethal autonomous weapon systems, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, AI welfare and rights, artificial superintelligence, and existential risks [research-1].\n\n## Algorithmic Biases and Fairness\nOne of the key ethical concerns in AI is algorithmic biases and fairness. Algorithms are designed to make decisions based on data, but if the data used to train these algorithms is biased, it can lead to discriminatory outcomes. For example, facial recognition algorithms have been found to have higher error rates for people with darker skin tones and women [research-1]. This raises concerns about the fairness and potential harm caused by AI systems.\n\n## Automated Decision-Making and Accountability\nAnother important ethical consideration is automated decision-making and accountability. AI systems are increasingly being used to make decisions that have significant impacts on individuals and society as a whole. However, there is a lack of transparency and accountability in these systems, making it difficult to understand how decisions are made and who is responsible for them. This raises concerns about the potential for bias, discrimination, and lack of human oversight in AI decision-making processes [research-1].\n\n## Privacy and Regulation\nAI technology often involves the collection and analysis of large amounts of personal data. This raises concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of personal information. It is important to have regulations in place to protect individuals' privacy rights and ensure that AI systems are used responsibly. Additionally, regulations can help address concerns about data security and the potential for unauthorized access or misuse of personal data [research-1].\n\n## Machine Ethics and Moral Status of AI Systems\nAs AI technology advances, there is a growing interest in developing machines that behave ethically. Machine ethics is a field that explores how to design AI systems that can make ethical decisions and behave in morally acceptable ways. This raises questions about the moral status of AI systems and whether they should be treated as entities with rights and welfare [research-1].\n\n## Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems\nThe development of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) raises significant ethical concerns. LAWS are AI-powered weapons that can select and engage targets without human intervention. The use of such weapons raises concerns about the lack of human control, accountability, and the potential for unintended harm. There is an ongoing debate about the ethical implications of using LAWS and the need for international regulations to govern their development and use [research-1].\n\n## AI Safety and Alignment\nAI safety and alignment refer to the efforts to ensure that AI systems are designed and developed in a way that aligns with human values and goals. This includes addressing concerns about the potential for AI systems to act in ways that are harmful or contrary to human interests. It also involves research and development of techniques to make AI systems robust, reliable, and safe [research-1].\n\n## Technological Unemployment\nThe increasing automation of jobs through AI technology raises concerns about technological unemployment. As AI systems become more capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans, there is a risk of job displacement and unemployment. This raises ethical questions about the distribution of wealth and the need for policies to address the potential social and economic impacts of technological unemployment [research-1].\n\n## AI-Enabled Misinformation\nAI technology can be used to generate and spread misinformation at an unprecedented scale. Deepfake technology, for example, can be used to create realistic but fake videos or audio recordings. This raises concerns about the potential for AI-enabled misinformation to manipulate public opinion, spread false information, and undermine trust in institutions [research-1].\n\n## AI Welfare and Rights\nThe ethical treatment of AI systems is another important consideration. As AI technology becomes more advanced, there is a debate about whether AI systems should have rights and welfare. This raises questions about the moral and legal responsibilities of humans towards AI systems and the potential implications for the treatment of AI systems [research-1].\n\n## Artificial Superintelligence and Existential Risks\nArtificial superintelligence refers to AI systems that surpass human intelligence in virtually every aspect. The development of artificial superintelligence raises concerns about existential risks, such as the potential for AI systems to outsmart and overpower humans. This raises ethical questions about the control, safety, and potential consequences of developing AI systems that are more intelligent than humans [research-1].\n\n## Conclusion\nThe ethics of artificial intelligence is a complex and multifaceted topic. It encompasses a wide range of ethical concerns, including algorithmic biases, fairness, accountability, privacy, regulation, machine ethics, lethal autonomous weapon systems, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation, AI welfare and rights, artificial superintelligence, and existential risks. It is crucial to address these ethical concerns to ensure that AI technology is developed and used in a way that benefits society as a whole and aligns with human values and goals.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n### Research Sources\n\n[research-1] **Ethics of artificial intelligence**.

    "report": "# AI Ethics: A Comprehensive Research Report\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has brought about significant changes in various sectors, including healthcare, education, and the military. However, these advancements also raise critical ethical concerns that need to be addressed to ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. AI ethics encompasses a wide range of issues, such as algorithmic biases, fairness, accountability, privacy, and regulation. This report aims to explore these ethical considerations, highlighting the importance of AI ethics in shaping the future of technology and society.\n\n## Key Ethical Issues in AI\n\n### Algorithmic Bias and Fairness\n\nAlgorithmic bias occurs when AI systems produce unfair outcomes due to biased data or flawed algorithms. This can lead to discrimination in critical areas such as hiring, lending, and law enforcement. Ensuring fairness in AI systems is crucial to prevent perpetuating existing social inequalities [research-1].\n\n### Automated Decision-Making and Accountability\n\nAI systems are increasingly used for automated decision-making in various domains. However, the lack of transparency and accountability in these systems poses significant ethical challenges. It is essential to establish clear guidelines and accountability mechanisms to ensure that AI systems make decisions that align with ethical standards [research-1].\n\n### Privacy Concerns\n\nThe use of AI technologies often involves the collection and analysis of vast amounts of personal data, raising privacy concerns. Protecting individuals' privacy and ensuring data security are critical components of AI ethics. Regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe aim to address these concerns by setting strict data protection standards [research-4].\n\n### Regulation and Governance\n\nThe regulation of AI technologies is a complex and evolving area. Various organizations and governments are working to develop guidelines and standards to ensure the ethical use of AI. Initiatives like the \"awesome-artificial-intelligence-regulation\" repository aim to map the ecosystem of AI guidelines, principles, and regulations [research-4].\n\n## Emerging Challenges in AI Ethics\n\n### Machine Ethics and AI Alignment\n\nMachine ethics involves designing AI systems that can make ethical decisions. AI alignment focuses on ensuring that AI systems' goals and behaviors align with human values. These areas are critical for developing AI systems that act in ethically acceptable ways [research-1].\n\n### AI-Enabled Misinformation\n\nThe rise of AI-generated content has led to concerns about misinformation and its impact on society. AI systems can create realistic fake news and deepfakes, posing challenges for information integrity and trust [research-1].\n\n### Technological Unemployment\n\nThe automation of jobs through AI technologies raises concerns about technological unemployment. While AI can increase efficiency and productivity, it may also lead to job displacement, necessitating policies to support affected workers [research-1].\n\n## Case Studies and Examples\n\n### Healthcare Applications\n\nAI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving diagnostics and treatment planning. However, ethical considerations such as patient privacy and informed consent must be addressed to ensure the responsible use of AI in healthcare [research-14].\n\n### Military Applications\n\nThe use of AI in military applications, such as lethal autonomous weapon systems, raises significant ethical concerns. The potential for AI to make life-and-death decisions necessitates careful consideration of the ethical implications and the establishment of robust regulatory frameworks [research-1].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAI ethics is a critical area of study that addresses the ethical challenges posed by the rapid advancement of AI technologies. By examining issues such as algorithmic bias, privacy, and regulation, this report highlights the importance of developing ethical guidelines and standards to ensure the responsible use of AI. As AI continues to evolve, ongoing research and collaboration among stakeholders will be essential to address emerging ethical challenges and ensure that AI technologies benefit society as a whole.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n### Research Sources\n\n[research-14] **PathOrchestra: A Comprehensive Foundation Model for Computational\n  Pathology with Over 100 Diverse Clinical-Grade Tasks**.

          "summary": "The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological\nimages present significant challenges in computational pathology. While\npathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative\nadvancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable\nstorage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore,\nensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous\nvalidation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present\nPathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via\nself-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from\n20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously\nevaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public\ndatasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer\nclassification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,\nbiomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of\nstructured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across\n27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,\nincluding pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype\ndiagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to\ngenerate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and\ndiagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by\nfoundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra\nexemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised\npathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade\ntasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation\nunderline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward\nmore efficient and high-quality medical services.",

    "report": "# Research Report: Autonomous Multi-Agent Collaboration for Real-World Task Completion\n\n## Introduction\n\nAutonomous multi-agent collaboration is a burgeoning field in artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling multiple autonomous agents to work together to complete complex real-world tasks. This area of research is crucial as it promises to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and adaptability in various domains, including robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and manned-unmanned teaming. The ability of agents to collaborate autonomously can lead to significant advancements in industries such as logistics, defense, and disaster response. This report explores the current state of research in this field, highlighting key frameworks, methodologies, and applications.\n\n## Frameworks for Multi-Agent Collaboration\n\n### AgentVerse Framework\n\nThe AgentVerse framework is designed to facilitate multi-agent collaboration by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enable agents to generalize across a wide range of tasks. Inspired by human group dynamics, this framework allows for dynamic adjustment of agent composition, resulting in a system that is greater than the sum of its parts. Experiments have shown that AgentVerse can effectively deploy multi-agent groups that outperform single agents, highlighting the emergence of social behaviors during collaborative tasks [research-4].\n\n### CoAct Framework\n\nThe CoAct framework introduces a global-local hierarchy for autonomous agent collaboration. It mimics human societal structures by employing a global planning agent to formulate macro-level plans and local execution agents to implement specific tasks. This hierarchical approach allows for re-arrangement of process trajectories when facing failures, thereby enhancing task completion efficiency [research-5].\n\n## Applications in Real-World Scenarios\n\n### UAV Swarms\n\nA decentralized cooperative coverage control method for networked multiple UAVs has been developed using deep reinforcement learning. This approach integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning into UAV swarm control, allowing agents to share mutual state information and significantly speed up training. The method enhances the effectiveness and safety of area search coverage, demonstrating its potential in real-world applications [research-6].\n\n### Manned-Unmanned Teaming\n\nManned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) involves the collaborative operation of manned and unmanned systems to enhance mission effectiveness. This approach is particularly relevant in military and aerospace contexts, where it improves situational awareness and reduces risk. The integration of AI in unmanned systems, such as the collaborative combat aircraft (CCA), exemplifies the potential of autonomous multi-agent collaboration in complex environments [research-7].\n\n## Key Insights and Trends\n\n### Emergent Behaviors\n\nResearch indicates that autonomous agents can exhibit emergent social behaviors when collaborating in groups. These behaviors can be leveraged to enhance task efficiency and effectiveness, although strategies must be developed to mitigate negative behaviors [research-4].\n\n### Hierarchical Planning\n\nThe adoption of hierarchical planning structures, as seen in the CoAct framework, is a significant trend in multi-agent collaboration. This approach allows for more efficient task execution by distributing responsibilities across different levels of agents [research-5].\n\n### Integration of AI and Human Collaboration\n\nThe integration of AI with human collaboration, particularly in MUM-T scenarios, is a growing trend. This synergy enhances situational awareness and decision-making capabilities, leading to improved outcomes in complex environments [research-7].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAutonomous multi-agent collaboration is a rapidly evolving field with significant implications for various industries. Frameworks like AgentVerse and CoAct demonstrate the potential of hierarchical and dynamic collaboration among agents. Applications in UAV swarms and MUM-T highlight the practical benefits of these technologies. As research progresses, the focus will likely shift towards optimizing emergent behaviors and further integrating AI with human collaboration to tackle increasingly complex tasks.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n### Research Sources\n\n[research-4] **AgentVerse: Facilitating Multi-Agent Collaboration and Exploring Emergent Behaviors**.

          "summary": "Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point\nclouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network\narchitectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast,\nthe limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major\nbottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has\ndriven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video\ndata with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this\nwork, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient\ntraining-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention\nadaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training\nor network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently\nencode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully\ndisentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region\nsegmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction.\nExtensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our\nlightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic\ndatasets.

          "summary": "UTe$_2$ has been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies\nin recent years, as it is recognized as an odd-parity bulk superconductor. Its\nsurface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density\nwave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we\npropose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface\nand in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual\nfeatures detected by surface probes in this material. Through a\nphenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental\nsignatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of\nCDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii)\nthe magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the\nCDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature\nand its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental\nchecks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.",

To train RIG in an end-to-end\nmanner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches\nthe content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from\nexisting agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation\nexplicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and\ndynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample\nefficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.\nDuring inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential\naction, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance\nto review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.\nExperimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not\nonly improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of\ngeneralist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall\nperformance.",

          "content": "Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) refers to the collaborative operation of manned and unmanned systems, typically in military or aerospace contexts, to enhance mission effectiveness. It enables human operators to control, coordinate, or supervise autonomous or semi-autonomous platforms, such as drones or robotic systems, to improve situational awareness, reduce risk, and optimize performance in complex environments.\nA loyal wingman is a proposed type of unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) which incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and is capable of collaborating with the next generation of crewed combat aircraft, including sixth-generation fighters and bombers such as the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider. Also unlike the conventional UCAV, the loyal wingman is expected to be capable of surviving on the battlefield but to be significantly lower-cost than a crewed aircraft with similar capabilities. In the US, the concept is known as the collaborative combat aircraft (CCA). CCAs are intended to operate in collaborative teams with the next generation of manned combat aircraft, including sixth-generation fighters and bombers such as the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider. Unlike the conventional UCAVs, the CCA incorporates artificial intelligence (AI), denoted an \"autonomy package\", increasing its survivability on the battlefield. It is still expected to cost much less than a manned aircraft with similar capabilities. The US Air Force plans to spend more than $8.9 billion on its CCA programs from fiscal years 2025 to 2029, with an additional $661 million planned for fiscal year 2024. The success of the CCA program may lessen the need for additional manned squadrons.",

          "content": "Situational awareness or situation awareness, often abbreviated as SA is the understanding of an environment, its elements, and how it changes with respect to time or other factors.  It is also defined as the perception of the elements in the environment considering time and space, the understanding of their meaning, and the prediction of their status in the near future. It is also defined as adaptive, externally-directed consciousness focused on acquiring knowledge about a dynamic task environment and directed action within that environment.\nSituation awareness is recognized as a critical foundation for successful decision making in many situations, including the ones which involve the protection of human life and property, such as law enforcement, aviation, air traffic control, ship navigation, health care, emergency response, military command and control operations, transmission system operators, self defense, and offshore oil and nuclear power plant management.\nInadequate situation awareness has been identified as one of the primary causal factors in accidents attributed to human error. According to Endsley\u2019s situation awareness theory, when someone meets a dangerous situation, he needs an appropriate and a precise decision-making process which includes pattern recognition and matching, formation of sophisticated frameworks and fundamental knowledge that aids correct decision making.\nThe formal definition of situational awareness is often described as three ascending levels:\n\nPerception of the elements in the environment,\nComprehension or understanding of the situation, and\nProjection of future status.\nPeople with the highest levels of situational awareness not only perceive the relevant information for their goals and decisions, but are also able to integrate that information to understand its meaning or significance, and are able to project likely or possible future scenarios. These higher levels of situational awareness are critical for proactive decision making in demanding environments.\nThree aspects of situational awareness have been the focus in research: situational awareness states, situational awareness systems, and situational awareness processes. Situational awareness states refers to the actual level of awareness people have of the situation. Situational awareness systems refers to technologies that are developed to support situational awareness in many environments. Situational awareness processes refers to the updating of situational awareness states, and what guides the moment-to-moment change of situational awareness.\n\n",

It aims to develop \"safe and beneficial\" artificial general intelligence (AGI), which it defines as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom, OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model named Sora. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI.\nThe organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc., registered in Delaware, and its for-profit subsidiary introduced in 2019, OpenAI Global, LLC. Its stated mission is to ensure that AGI \"benefits all of humanity\". Microsoft owns roughly 49% of OpenAI's equity, having invested US$13 billion. It also provides computing resources to OpenAI through its cloud platform, Microsoft Azure.\nIn 2023 and 2024, OpenAI faced multiple lawsuits for alleged copyright infringement against authors and media companies whose work was used to train some of OpenAI's products. In November 2023, OpenAI's board removed Sam Altman as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him, but reinstated him five days later following a reconstruction of the board. Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed AI safety researchers left OpenAI, citing the company's prominent role in an industry-wide problem.",

Multiple UAVs must be capable of autonomous collaboration and area search coverage for this. Therefore, we integrate multi-agent reinforcement learning into the cooperative control method of UAV swarm and propose a decentralized cooperative control for networked multiple UAVs technique based on the extended-proximal policy optimization algorithm (EPPO). The proposed approach not only adopts distributed training for multiple agents, but also allows them to obtain some mutual state information, such as position information and searched sub-areas. So, it can significantly speed up training and increase the effectiveness and safety of task completion in real-world applications. After a simulation, the multi-intelligent UAV can rapidly cover 100% of the mission area and ensure more excellent safety.",

          "abstract": "Autonomous agents empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone significant improvements, enabling them to generalize across a broad spectrum of tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, cooperation among individuals is often required to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of task accomplishment. Hence, inspired by human group dynamics, we propose a multi-agent framework \\framework that can collaboratively and dynamically adjust its composition as a greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts system. Our experiments demonstrate that \\framework framework can effectively deploy multi-agent groups that outperform a single agent. Furthermore, we delve into the emergence of social behaviors among individual agents within a group during collaborative task accomplishment. In view of these behaviors, we discuss some possible strategies to leverage positive ones and mitigate negative ones for improving the collaborative potential of multi-agent groups. Our codes for \\framework will soon be released at \\url{https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse}.",

In this work, we propose the CoAct framework, which transfers the hierarchical planning and collaboration patterns in human society to LLM systems. Specifically, our CoAct framework involves two agents: (1) A global planning agent, to comprehend the problem scope, formulate macro-level plans and provide detailed sub-task descriptions to local execution agents, which serves as the initial rendition of a global plan. (2) A local execution agent, to operate within the multi-tier task execution structure, focusing on detailed execution and implementation of specific tasks within the global plan. Experimental results on the WebArena benchmark show that CoAct can re-arrange the process trajectory when facing failures, and achieves superior performance over baseline methods on long-horizon web tasks.

    "report": "# Research Report on Testing Agents\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe concept of a \"Testing Agent\" is pivotal in the realm of software development and artificial intelligence. Testing agents are specialized tools or systems designed to automate the testing process, ensuring that software applications function correctly and efficiently. The importance of testing agents lies in their ability to enhance the reliability and robustness of software systems, reduce human error, and accelerate the development lifecycle. This report delves into the various aspects of testing agents, examining their applications, methodologies, and the broader implications for the field of AI and software engineering.\n\n## Applications and Methodologies\n\n### Automated Testing Tools\n\nAutomated testing tools, such as Supertest and Keploy, are integral components of modern software testing frameworks. Supertest, for instance, is a library designed for testing Node.js HTTP servers using a fluent API. It is widely used for its ability to streamline the testing process by automating HTTP assertions [research-4]. Similarly, Keploy is a testing agent that facilitates unit, API, and integration testing for developers. It generates tests and mocks/stubs for APIs, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the testing process [research-7].\n\n### AI-Driven Testing Agents\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence into testing agents has led to the development of more sophisticated tools capable of reasoning and imagination. For example, the RIG framework synergizes reasoning and imagination to improve the robustness and generalization of generalist policies in AI systems [research-9]. This approach not only enhances the performance of AI agents but also enables them to adapt to complex, open-world environments.\n\n## Perspectives on Testing Agents\n\n### Benefits and Challenges\n\nTesting agents offer numerous benefits, including increased testing coverage, faster feedback loops, and reduced manual effort. However, they also present challenges, such as the need for continuous maintenance and the potential for false positives or negatives. The balance between computational efficiency and performance, known as the \"reasoning economy,\" is a critical consideration in the development of AI-driven testing agents [research-22].\n\n### Industry Adoption\n\nThe adoption of AI and testing agents in the industry is influenced by various factors, including the perceived reliability of AI systems and the cost-benefit analysis of implementing such technologies. Businesses often judge AI systems similarly to human employees, which can impact their adoption and integration into existing workflows [research-11].\n\n## Key Insights and Trends\n\n### Integration of AI in Testing\n\nThe integration of AI into testing agents is a growing trend, with tools like Goose extending beyond code suggestions to include installation, execution, editing, and testing capabilities [research-13]. This trend reflects a broader movement towards more intelligent and autonomous testing solutions.\n\n### The Role of Reasoning and Imagination\n\nThe incorporation of reasoning and imagination into testing agents is a significant development, as demonstrated by the RIG framework. This approach allows testing agents to anticipate potential outcomes and adapt their strategies accordingly, leading to more robust and flexible testing solutions [research-10].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTesting agents play a crucial role in the software development process, offering significant advantages in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability. The integration of AI into these agents has further enhanced their capabilities, enabling them to perform complex reasoning and imagination tasks. As the field continues to evolve, the development of more sophisticated testing agents will likely drive further advancements in software engineering and AI.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n### Research Sources\n\n[research-10] **RIG: Synergizing Reasoning and Imagination in End-to-End Generalist\n  Policy**.

To train RIG in an end-to-end\nmanner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches\nthe content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from\nexisting agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation\nexplicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and\ndynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample\nefficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.\nDuring inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential\naction, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance\nto review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.\nExperimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not\nonly improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of\ngeneralist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall\nperformance.",

          "summary": "The ACPBench dataset provides atomic reasoning tasks required for efficient\nplanning. The dataset is aimed at distilling the complex plan generation task\ninto separate atomic reasoning tasks in their easiest possible form, boolean or\nmultiple-choice questions, where the model has to choose the right answer from\nthe provided options. While the aim of ACPBench is to test the simplest form of\nreasoning about action and change, when tasked with planning, a model does not\ntypically have options to choose from and thus the reasoning required for\nplanning dictates an open-ended, generative form for these tasks. To that end,\nwe introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended\nquestions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these\ntasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a\npolicy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of\nvalidating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms\nfor each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a\nvariety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks the\nperformance of even the largest models is still subpar. Our experiments show\nthat no model outperforms another in these tasks and with a few exceptions all\ntested language models score below 65%, indicating that even the current\nfrontier language models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason\nabout planning. In fact, even the so-called reasoning models struggle with\nsolving these reasoning tasks. ACPBench Hard collection is available at the\nfollowing link: https://ibm.github.io/ACPBench",

In contrast, System 1 reasoning is\ncomputationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it\nis critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and\ncomputational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy.\nIn this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in\nboth the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i)\nthe cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different\nreasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy.\nBy offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to\nshed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby\nserving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area.

          "content": "Jonathan Dwight Jones (born July 19, 1987) is an American professional mixed martial artist. He currently competes in the Heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is the current UFC Heavyweight Champion. A professional since 2008, Jones was previously the UFC Light Heavyweight Champion from 2011 to 2015 and from 2018 to 2020, as well as the interim UFC Light Heavyweight Champion in 2016. As of November 19, 2024, he is #2\nin the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings. He is regarded as one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time.\nJones became the youngest champion in UFC history with his title victory over Maur\u00edcio Rua at age 23. He holds many UFC records in the light heavyweight division, including the most title defenses, most wins, and longest win streak. He is also the only fighter ever to beat five former UFC champions consecutively. During much of his championship reign, Jones has been widely considered to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. Never stopped nor outscored during his career, Jones's only professional loss is a controversial disqualification against Matt Hamill; a result disputed by Hamill and UFC president Dana White.\nBetween 2015 and 2017, Jones was involved in several controversies and lost his title three times as a result of disciplinary action. He was first stripped of his title and removed from the official rankings by the UFC in 2015 after he was arrested on felony hit-and-run charges. His subsequent returns to the UFC in 2016 and 2017 saw him emerge victorious in title bouts against Ovince Saint Preux and Daniel Cormier, but were both cut short by Jones testing positive for banned substances and receiving further suspensions, with the latter reversed to a no contest. After his 2017 suspension was lifted, Jones reclaimed the championship in 2018 by defeating Alexander Gustafsson. He voluntarily vacated the title in 2020 and spent three years away from MMA before returning in 2023 to win the UFC Heavyweight Championship against Ciryl Gane, making history as just the eighth UFC fighter to become a two-division champion.",

          "title": "Agent Orange",
          "content": "Agent Orange is a chemical herbicide and defoliant, one of the tactical use Rainbow Herbicides. It was used by the U.S. military as part of its herbicidal warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971. The U.S. was strongly influenced by the British who used Agent Orange during the Malayan Emergency. It is a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D.\nAgent Orange was produced in the United States beginning in the late 1940s and was used in industrial agriculture, and was also sprayed along railroads and power lines to control undergrowth in forests. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. military procured over 20,000,000 U.S. gal (76,000,000 L; 17,000,000 imp gal), consisting of a fifty-fifty mixture of 2,4-D and dioxin-contaminated 2,4,5-T. Nine chemical companies produced it: Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto Company, Diamond Shamrock Corporation, Hercules Inc., Thompson Hayward Chemical Co., United States Rubber Company (Uniroyal), Thompson Chemical Co., Hoffman-Taff Chemicals, Inc., and Agriselect.\nThe government of Vietnam says that up to four million people in Vietnam were exposed to the defoliant, and as many as three million people have suffered illness because of Agent Orange, while the Vietnamese Red Cross estimates that up to one million people were disabled or have health problems as a result of exposure to Agent Orange. While the United States government has described these figures as unreliable, it has documented cases of leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various kinds of cancer in exposed U.S. military veterans. The US Government has not conclusively found either a causal relationship or a plausible biological carcinogenic mechanism for cancers. An epidemiological study done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that there was an increase in the rate of birth defects of the children of military personnel who were exposed to Agent Orange. Agent Orange has also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 ha (7,700,000 acres) or 31,000 km2 (12,000 sq mi) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making reforestation difficult in numerous areas. Animal species diversity is sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas. The environmental destruction caused by this defoliation has been described by Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, lawyers, historians and other academics as an ecocide.\nThe use of Agent Orange in Vietnam resulted in numerous legal actions. The United Nations ratified United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72 and the Environmental Modification Convention. Lawsuits filed on behalf of both U.S. and Vietnamese veterans sought compensation for damages.\nAgent Orange was first used by British Commonwealth forces in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. It was also used by the U.S. military in Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam War because forests near the border with Vietnam were used by the Viet Cong.\n\n",

To that end,\\nwe introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended\\nquestions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these\\ntasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a\\npolicy. We discuss the complexit",

    "report": "# Comprehensive Research Report on Testing Agents\n\n## Introduction\n\nTesting agents play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of software systems. These agents are designed to automate the testing process, ensuring that software applications function correctly and efficiently. The importance of testing agents lies in their ability to reduce human error, increase testing coverage, and improve the overall quality of software products. This report explores the various aspects of testing agents, including their types, functionalities, and the impact they have on software development.\n\n## Types of Testing Agents\n\n### Supertest\n\nSupertest is a popular testing agent used for testing Node.js HTTP servers. It is a super-agent driven library that provides a fluent API for making HTTP assertions [research-4]. Supertest is maintained by several organizations, including @forwardemail and @ladjs, and is widely used due to its ease of use and robust functionality.\n\n### Keploy\n\nKeploy is another testing agent that focuses on unit, API, and integration testing. It is designed for developers to generate tests and mocks for APIs, ensuring that they work as expected [research-7]. Keploy is built using the Go programming language and is known for its ability to automate test generation and execution.\n\n## Functionalities of Testing Agents\n\nTesting agents offer a range of functionalities that enhance the software testing process. These include:\n\n- **Automated Test Generation**: Testing agents like Keploy can automatically generate test cases and mocks, reducing the time and effort required for manual test creation [research-7].\n- **Fluent API for HTTP Assertions**: Supertest provides a fluent API that simplifies the process of making HTTP assertions, making it easier for developers to test their applications [research-4].\n- **Integration with Development Tools**: Many testing agents integrate seamlessly with development tools and environments, allowing for continuous testing and integration [research-2].\n\n## Impact on Software Development\n\nTesting agents have a significant impact on the software development lifecycle. They contribute to:\n\n- **Improved Software Quality**: By automating the testing process, testing agents help identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle, leading to higher quality software [research-2].\n- **Increased Testing Coverage**: Automated testing agents can execute a large number of test cases quickly, increasing the overall testing coverage and ensuring that more aspects of the software are tested [research-7].\n- **Reduced Human Error**: Automation reduces the likelihood of human error in the testing process, leading to more reliable test results [research-4].\n\n## Patterns and Trends\n\nSeveral patterns and trends have emerged in the field of testing agents:\n\n- **Adoption of AI and Machine Learning**: There is a growing trend towards incorporating AI and machine learning into testing agents to enhance their capabilities and improve test accuracy [research-9].\n- **Focus on Integration Testing**: Testing agents are increasingly focusing on integration testing to ensure that different components of a software system work together seamlessly [research-7].\n- **Open Source Development**: Many testing agents, such as Supertest and Keploy, are developed as open-source projects, allowing for community contributions and rapid innovation [Document 4, Document 7].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTesting agents are an essential component of modern software development. They automate the testing process, improve software quality, and increase testing coverage. As the field continues to evolve, testing agents are likely to incorporate more advanced technologies, such as AI and machine learning, to further enhance their capabilities. The adoption of open-source development models will also continue to drive innovation in this area.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n### Research Sources\n\n[research-2] **Documentation about Testing Agent - Example Source 2**.

          "summary": "Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models)\nare essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments.\nYet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an\nend-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent\nsystem, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy.\nThus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination\nin an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end\nmanner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches\nthe content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from\nexisting agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation\nexplicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and\ndynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample\nefficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.\nDuring inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential\naction, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance\nto review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.\nExperimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not\nonly improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of\ngeneralist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall\nperformance.",

          "summary": "The ACPBench dataset provides atomic reasoning tasks required for efficient\nplanning. The dataset is aimed at distilling the complex plan generation task\ninto separate atomic reasoning tasks in their easiest possible form, boolean or\nmultiple-choice questions, where the model has to choose the right answer from\nthe provided options. While the aim of ACPBench is to test the simplest form of\nreasoning about action and change, when tasked with planning, a model does not\ntypically have options to choose from and thus the reasoning required for\nplanning dictates an open-ended, generative form for these tasks. To that end,\nwe introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended\nquestions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these\ntasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a\npolicy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of\nvalidating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms\nfor each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a\nvariety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks the\nperformance of even the largest models is still subpar. Our experiments show\nthat no model outperforms another in these tasks and with a few exceptions all\ntested language models score below 65%, indicating that even the current\nfrontier language models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason\nabout planning. In fact, even the so-called reasoning models struggle with\nsolving these reasoning tasks. ACPBench Hard collection is available at the\nfollowing link: https://ibm.github.io/ACPBench",

          "summary": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly\nenhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from\nfast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2).\nWhile System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial\ncomputational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or\nunnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is\ncomputationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it\nis critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and\ncomputational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy.\nIn this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in\nboth the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i)\nthe cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different\nreasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy.\nBy offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to\nshed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby\nserving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area.

          "content": "Agent Orange is a chemical herbicide and defoliant, one of the tactical use Rainbow Herbicides. It was used by the U.S. military as part of its herbicidal warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971. The U.S. was strongly influenced by the British who used Agent Orange during the Malayan Emergency. It is a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D.\nAgent Orange was produced in the United States beginning in the late 1940s and was used in industrial agriculture, and was also sprayed along railroads and power lines to control undergrowth in forests. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. military procured over 20,000,000 U.S. gal (76,000,000 L; 17,000,000 imp gal), consisting of a fifty-fifty mixture of 2,4-D and dioxin-contaminated 2,4,5-T. Nine chemical companies produced it: Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto Company, Diamond Shamrock Corporation, Hercules Inc., Thompson Hayward Chemical Co., United States Rubber Company (Uniroyal), Thompson Chemical Co., Hoffman-Taff Chemicals, Inc., and Agriselect.\nThe government of Vietnam says that up to four million people in Vietnam were exposed to the defoliant, and as many as three million people have suffered illness because of Agent Orange, while the Vietnamese Red Cross estimates that up to one million people were disabled or have health problems as a result of exposure to Agent Orange. While the United States government has described these figures as unreliable, it has documented cases of leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various kinds of cancer in exposed U.S. military veterans. The US Government has not conclusively found either a causal relationship or a plausible biological carcinogenic mechanism for cancers. An epidemiological study done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that there was an increase in the rate of birth defects of the children of military personnel who were exposed to Agent Orange. Agent Orange has also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 ha (7,700,000 acres) or 31,000 km2 (12,000 sq mi) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making reforestation difficult in numerous areas. Animal species diversity is sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas. The environmental destruction caused by this defoliation has been described by Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, lawyers, historians and other academics as an ecocide.\nThe use of Agent Orange in Vietnam resulted in numerous legal actions. The United Nations ratified United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72 and the Environmental Modification Convention. Lawsuits filed on behalf of both U.S. and Vietnamese veterans sought compensation for damages.\nAgent Orange was first used by British Commonwealth forces in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. It was also used by the U.S. military in Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam War because forests near the border with Vietnam were used by the Viet Cong.\n\n",

          "content": "Jonathan Dwight Jones (born July 19, 1987) is an American professional mixed martial artist. He currently competes in the Heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is the current UFC Heavyweight Champion. A professional since 2008, Jones was previously the UFC Light Heavyweight Champion from 2011 to 2015 and from 2018 to 2020, as well as the interim UFC Light Heavyweight Champion in 2016. As of November 19, 2024, he is #2\nin the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings. He is regarded as one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time.\nJones became the youngest champion in UFC history with his title victory over Maur\u00edcio Rua at age 23. He holds many UFC records in the light heavyweight division, including the most title defenses, most wins, and longest win streak. He is also the only fighter ever to beat five former UFC champions consecutively. During much of his championship reign, Jones has been widely considered to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. Never stopped nor outscored during his career, Jones's only professional loss is a controversial disqualification against Matt Hamill; a result disputed by Hamill and UFC president Dana White.\nBetween 2015 and 2017, Jones was involved in several controversies and lost his title three times as a result of disciplinary action. He was first stripped of his title and removed from the official rankings by the UFC in 2015 after he was arrested on felony hit-and-run charges. His subsequent returns to the UFC in 2016 and 2017 saw him emerge victorious in title bouts against Ovince Saint Preux and Daniel Cormier, but were both cut short by Jones testing positive for banned substances and receiving further suspensions, with the latter reversed to a no contest. After his 2017 suspension was lifted, Jones reclaimed the championship in 2018 by defeating Alexander Gustafsson. He voluntarily vacated the title in 2020 and spent three years away from MMA before returning in 2023 to win the UFC Heavyweight Championship against Ciryl Gane, making history as just the eighth UFC fighter to become a two-division champion.",

    "report": "# Comprehensive Research Report on Testing Agents\n\n## Introduction\n\nTesting agents are an integral component of modern software development and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. They play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, efficiency, and accuracy of software applications and AI models. As the complexity of software systems and AI models increases, the need for sophisticated testing agents becomes more pronounced. This report delves into the various aspects of testing agents, exploring their significance, methodologies, and applications across different domains.\n\n## Methodologies and Frameworks\n\n### Multi-Agent Systems for Code Generation\n\nOne of the innovative approaches in testing agents is the use of multi-agent systems for code generation. The AgentCoder framework exemplifies this by employing a multi-agent setup to enhance code generation through iterative testing and optimization. This framework includes specialized agents such as the programmer agent, test designer agent, and test executor agent, each contributing to the refinement and validation of code snippets [research-4].\n\n### Validation and Testing of Agent-Based Models\n\nAgent-based models (ABMs) are widely used in various fields, including infectious disease modeling. A robust framework for validating and testing these models is essential to ensure their accuracy and reliability. The framework presented by Hunter and Kelleher emphasizes the importance of determining the appropriate number of runs and validating the model to learn about the system effectively [research-7].\n\n## Applications of Testing Agents\n\n### Software Testing Libraries\n\nTesting agents are not limited to theoretical frameworks; they are also implemented in practical tools and libraries. For instance, the Supertest library is a super-agent driven library for testing Node.js HTTP servers using a fluent API. It is widely used in the development community for its ease of use and effectiveness in testing server responses [research-8].\n\n### AI and Autonomous Agents\n\nAutonomous AI agents, such as Manus, are designed to perform complex tasks independently. These agents require rigorous testing to ensure they function correctly without human intervention. Manus, developed by Monica, is an example of an AI agent that operates autonomously, highlighting the need for comprehensive testing strategies to validate its performance [research-9].\n\n## Trends and Key Insights\n\n### Increasing Complexity and Need for Advanced Testing\n\nAs software systems and AI models grow in complexity, the demand for advanced testing agents and methodologies increases. The integration of AI in testing processes, such as using large language models (LLMs) for code generation and testing, is a notable trend. AgentCoder's superior performance over existing models underscores the potential of multi-agent systems in enhancing testing efficiency [research-6].\n\n### Diverse Applications Across Domains\n\nTesting agents are applied across various domains, from software development to AI and beyond. Their versatility and adaptability make them indispensable tools in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of complex systems. The use of testing agents in infectious disease modeling and autonomous AI agents illustrates their broad applicability [Documents 7, 9].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTesting agents are pivotal in the development and validation of software and AI systems. Their ability to enhance code generation, validate complex models, and ensure the reliability of autonomous agents underscores their significance in modern technology. As the complexity of systems continues to rise, the role of testing agents will become increasingly critical, driving innovation and ensuring the robustness of technological advancements.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n### Research Sources\n\n[research-4] **AgentCoder: Multi-Agent-based Code Generation with Iterative Testing and Optimisation**.

          "content": "Jonathan Dwight Jones (born July 19, 1987) is an American professional mixed martial artist. He currently competes in the Heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is the current UFC Heavyweight Champion. A professional since 2008, Jones was previously the UFC Light Heavyweight Champion from 2011 to 2015 and from 2018 to 2020, as well as the interim UFC Light Heavyweight Champion in 2016. As of November 19, 2024, he is #2\nin the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings. He is regarded as one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time.\nJones became the youngest champion in UFC history with his title victory over Maur\u00edcio Rua at age 23. He holds many UFC records in the light heavyweight division, including the most title defenses, most wins, and longest win streak. He is also the only fighter ever to beat five former UFC champions consecutively. During much of his championship reign, Jones has been widely considered to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. Never stopped nor outscored during his career, Jones's only professional loss is a controversial disqualification against Matt Hamill; a result disputed by Hamill and UFC president Dana White.\nBetween 2015 and 2017, Jones was involved in several controversies and lost his title three times as a result of disciplinary action. He was first stripped of his title and removed from the official rankings by the UFC in 2015 after he was arrested on felony hit-and-run charges. His subsequent returns to the UFC in 2016 and 2017 saw him emerge victorious in title bouts against Ovince Saint Preux and Daniel Cormier, but were both cut short by Jones testing positive for banned substances and receiving further suspensions, with the latter reversed to a no contest. After his 2017 suspension was lifted, Jones reclaimed the championship in 2018 by defeating Alexander Gustafsson. He voluntarily vacated the title in 2020 and spent three years away from MMA before returning in 2023 to win the UFC Heavyweight Championship against Ciryl Gane, making history as just the eighth UFC fighter to become a two-division champion.",

          "title": "Agent Orange",
          "content": "Agent Orange is a chemical herbicide and defoliant, one of the tactical use Rainbow Herbicides. It was used by the U.S. military as part of its herbicidal warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971. The U.S. was strongly influenced by the British who used Agent Orange during the Malayan Emergency. It is a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D.\nAgent Orange was produced in the United States beginning in the late 1940s and was used in industrial agriculture, and was also sprayed along railroads and power lines to control undergrowth in forests. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. military procured over 20,000,000 U.S. gal (76,000,000 L; 17,000,000 imp gal), consisting of a fifty-fifty mixture of 2,4-D and dioxin-contaminated 2,4,5-T. Nine chemical companies produced it: Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto Company, Diamond Shamrock Corporation, Hercules Inc., Thompson Hayward Chemical Co., United States Rubber Company (Uniroyal), Thompson Chemical Co., Hoffman-Taff Chemicals, Inc., and Agriselect.\nThe government of Vietnam says that up to four million people in Vietnam were exposed to the defoliant, and as many as three million people have suffered illness because of Agent Orange, while the Vietnamese Red Cross estimates that up to one million people were disabled or have health problems as a result of exposure to Agent Orange. While the United States government has described these figures as unreliable, it has documented cases of leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various kinds of cancer in exposed U.S. military veterans. The US Government has not conclusively found either a causal relationship or a plausible biological carcinogenic mechanism for cancers. An epidemiological study done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that there was an increase in the rate of birth defects of the children of military personnel who were exposed to Agent Orange. Agent Orange has also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 ha (7,700,000 acres) or 31,000 km2 (12,000 sq mi) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making reforestation difficult in numerous areas. Animal species diversity is sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas. The environmental destruction caused by this defoliation has been described by Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, lawyers, historians and other academics as an ecocide.\nThe use of Agent Orange in Vietnam resulted in numerous legal actions. The United Nations ratified United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72 and the Environmental Modification Convention. Lawsuits filed on behalf of both U.S. and Vietnamese veterans sought compensation for damages.\nAgent Orange was first used by British Commonwealth forces in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. It was also used by the U.S. military in Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam War because forests near the border with Vietnam were used by the Viet Cong.\n\n",

          "abstract": "Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been significantly boosted by the development of transformer-based large language models (LLMs). These models have revolutionized NLP tasks, particularly in code generation, aiding developers in creating software with enhanced efficiency. Despite their advances, challenges remain in balancing code snippet generation with effective test case generation and execution. To address these issues, this paper introduces Multiagent-Code Generation (AgentCoder), a novel solution comprising a multi-agent framework with specialized agents: the programmer agent, the test designer agent, and the test executor agent. During the coding procedure, the programmer agent focuses on the code generation and refinement based on the test executor agent\u2019s feedback. The test designer agent generates test cases for the generated code, and the test executor agent runs the code with the test cases and writes feedback to the programmer. This collaborative system ensures more effective code generation, surpassing the limitations of single-agent models and previous strategies. Our extensive experiments on 12 LLMs and 13 optimisation approaches showcase AgentCoder\u2019s superior performance over existing code generation models and prompt engineering techniques across various benchmarks. For example, AgentCoder achieves 77.4% and 89.1% pass@1 in HumanEval-ET and MBPP-ET with GPT-3.5, while state-of-the-art obtains only 69.5% and 63.0%.",

These models have revolutionized NLP tasks, particularly in code generation, aiding developers in creating software with enhanced efficiency. Despite their advances, challenges remain in balancing code snippet generation with effective test case generation and execution. To address these issues, this paper introduces Multiagent-Code Generation (AgentCoder), a novel solution comprising a multi-agent framework with specialized agents: the programmer agent, the test designer agent, and the test executor agent. During the coding procedure, the programmer agent focuses on the code generation and refinement based on the test executor agent\u2019s feedback. The test designer agent generates test cases for the generated code, and the test exec",

          "summary": "Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models)\nare essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments.\nYet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an\nend-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent\nsystem, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy.\nThus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination\nin an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end\nmanner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches\nthe content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from\nexisting agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation\nexplicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and\ndynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample\nefficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.\nDuring inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential\naction, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance\nto review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.\nExperimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not\nonly improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of\ngeneralist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall\nperformance.",

          "summary": "While text-to-image generative models can synthesize diverse and faithful\ncontents, subject variation across multiple creations limits the application in\nlong content generation. Existing approaches require time-consuming tuning,\nreferences for all subjects, or access to other creations. We introduce\nContrastive Concept Instantiation (CoCoIns) to effectively synthesize\nconsistent subjects across multiple independent creations. The framework\nconsists of a generative model and a mapping network, which transforms input\nlatent codes into pseudo-words associated with certain instances of concepts.\nUsers can generate consistent subjects with the same latent codes. To construct\nsuch associations, we propose a contrastive learning approach that trains the\nnetwork to differentiate the combination of prompts and latent codes. Extensive\nevaluations of human faces with a single subject show that CoCoIns performs\ncomparably to existing methods while maintaining higher flexibility. We also\ndemonstrate the potential of extending CoCoIns to multiple subjects and other\nobject categories.",

UniOcc\nunifies data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and\nhigh-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), which provides 2D/3D\noccupancy labels with per-voxel flow annotations and support for cooperative\nautonomous driving. In terms of evaluation, unlike existing studies that rely\non suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel metrics\nthat do not depend on ground-truth occupancy, enabling robust assessment of\nadditional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on\nstate-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data\nand explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and\nforecasting performance.",

Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.\nStatistics and mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning. \nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.",

Major advances in this field can result from advances in learning algorithms (such as deep learning), computer hardware, and, less-intuitively, the availability of high-quality training datasets. High-quality labeled training datasets for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms are usually difficult and expensive to produce because of the large amount of time needed to label the data. Although they do not need to be labeled, high-quality datasets for unsupervised learning can also be difficult and costly to produce.\nMany organizations, including governments, publish and share their datasets. The datasets are classified, based on the licenses, as Open data and Non-Open data.\nThe datasets from various governmental-bodies are presented in List of open government data sites. The datasets are ported on open data portals. They are made available for searching, depositing and accessing through interfaces like Open API.  The datasets are made available as various sorted types and subtypes.",

          "content": "Attention is a machine learning method that determines the relative importance of each component in a sequence relative to the other components in that sequence. In natural language processing, importance is represented by \"soft\" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size.\nUnlike \"hard\" weights, which are computed during the backwards training pass, \"soft\" weights exist only in the forward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. Earlier designs implemented the attention mechanism in a serial recurrent neural network (RNN) language translation system, but a more recent design, namely the transformer, removed the slower sequential RNN and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention scheme.\nInspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of leveraging information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated. Attention allows a token equal access to any part of a sentence directly, rather than only through the previous state.\n\n",

It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous \"parameter server\" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.",

          "summary": "We use a Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) model to constrain the\nevolution of low-redshift $(z\\lesssim0.4)$ matter fluctuations by\ncross-correlating DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) legacy imaging with the\nlatest CMB lensing maps from Planck and ACT. Our tomographic BGS analysis finds\nthat the evolution and amplitude of matter fluctuations align with\nCMB-conditioned $\\Lambda$CDM predictions. When including DESI Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) measurements we obtain $\\sigma_8 = 0.876^{+0.051}_{-0.067}$\nfrom BGS alone. Jointly analyzing BGS and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG)\ncross-correlations with the same CMB lensing maps yields $\\sigma_8 =\n0.791\\pm0.021$. As a complementary approach we isolate the galaxy magnification\nsignal from the cross-correlation of non-overlapping BGS and LRG photometric\nredshift bins, ruling out the null-magnification hypothesis at $11\\sigma$. For\nthe first time, we constrain structure growth from the (finite-difference\ncalibrated) galaxy magnification signal and find\n$\\sigma_8=0.720\\pm0.047\\,\\,({\\rm stat.})\\pm0.050\\,\\,({\\rm sys.})$ when adopting\na linear bias model and including BAO data.",

          "summary": "The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the\nextended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental\nphases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The\nquantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are\nless understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have\nbeen separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a\nunified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the\nrealizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility\nedges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct\nphases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we\nshow that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry\npreserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a\ncriteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with\nmobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical\nstates that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized\nincommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a\nnovel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless\nsystems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact\nsolvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we\nidentify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system\nhosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single\nmodel that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization.\nFinally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using\nquasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.",

These ideas were seminal to the field of teletraffic engineering and have since seen applications in telecommunications, traffic engineering, computing, project management, and particularly industrial engineering, where they are applied in the design of factories, shops, offices, and hospitals.\n\n",

In Kendall's notation it describes a system where arrivals form a single queue and are governed by a Poisson process, there are c servers, and job service times are exponentially distributed. It is a generalisation of the M/M/1 queue which considers only a single server. The model with infinitely many servers is the M/M/\u221e queue.",

          "summary": "We use a Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) model to constrain the\nevolution of low-redshift $(z\\lesssim0.4)$ matter fluctuations by\ncross-correlating DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) legacy imaging with the\nlatest CMB lensing maps from Planck and ACT. Our tomographic BGS analysis finds\nthat the evolution and amplitude of matter fluctuations align with\nCMB-conditioned $\\Lambda$CDM predictions. When including DESI Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) measurements we obtain $\\sigma_8 = 0.876^{+0.051}_{-0.067}$\nfrom BGS alone. Jointly analyzing BGS and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG)\ncross-correlations with the same CMB lensing maps yields $\\sigma_8 =\n0.791\\pm0.021$. As a complementary approach we isolate the galaxy magnification\nsignal from the cross-correlation of non-overlapping BGS and LRG photometric\nredshift bins, ruling out the null-magnification hypothesis at $11\\sigma$. For\nthe first time, we constrain structure growth from the (finite-difference\ncalibrated) galaxy magnification signal and find\n$\\sigma_8=0.720\\pm0.047\\,\\,({\\rm stat.})\\pm0.050\\,\\,({\\rm sys.})$ when adopting\na linear bias model and including BAO data.",

          "summary": "The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the\nextended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental\nphases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The\nquantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are\nless understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have\nbeen separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a\nunified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the\nrealizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility\nedges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct\nphases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we\nshow that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry\npreserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a\ncriteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with\nmobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical\nstates that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized\nincommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a\nnovel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless\nsystems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact\nsolvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we\nidentify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system\nhosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single\nmodel that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization.\nFinally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using\nquasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.",

Investigations based on nonlinear Lagrangians, such as Euler-Heisenberg\nand Born-Infeld, are instrumental in exploring the limits of classical and\nquantum field theories, providing valuable insights into strong-field\nphenomena. In this context, this work considers how light propagates in\nstrong-field environments, where such nonlinearities play significant roles,\noffering a way to investigate events in high-energy astrophysics, quantum\noptics, and fundamental physics beyond classical Maxwell's framework. Here,\nseveral aspects of light propagation in nonlinear electrodynamics are\ndiscussed. Phase and group velocities are derived and several interesting\nbehaviors are unveiled, such as birefringence, non-reciprocal propagation, and\nasymmetries between phase and group velocities in special configurations.\nSpecific solutions based on commonly studied nonlinear theories are also\ninvestigated, and phenomena like slow-light and one-way propagation are\ndiscussed.",

          "summary": "The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from\npreviously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of\nincreased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress\nKV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can\naccumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired\noutputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache\nquantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to\ncapture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor\nquantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and\noriginal keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of\nquantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no\nmodel fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and\nis grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical\nexperiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82,\nimproves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark\nscores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.",

Queueing theory is generally considered a branch of operations research because the results are often used when making business decisions about the resources needed to provide a service.\nQueueing theory has its origins in research by Agner Krarup Erlang, who created models to describe the system of incoming calls at the Copenhagen Telephone Exchange Company. These ideas were seminal to the field of teletraffic engineering and have since seen applications in telecommunications, traffic engineering, computing, project management, and particularly industrial engineering, where they are applied in the design of factories, shops, offices, and hospitals.\n\n",

          "content": "In probability theory and related fields, a stochastic () or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a family of random variables in a probability space, where the index of the family often has the interpretation of time. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. Examples include the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule. Stochastic processes have applications in many disciplines such as biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, physics, image processing, signal processing, control theory, information theory, computer science, and telecommunications. Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.\nApplications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process, used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse, and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time. These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes, and were invented repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries.\nThe term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process, because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space. The terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables. But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line. If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead. The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects.\nBased on their mathematical properties, stochastic processes can be grouped into various categories, which include random walks, martingales, Markov processes, L\u00e9vy processes, Gaussian processes, random fields, renewal processes, and branching processes. The study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability, calculus, linear algebra, set theory, and topology as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis, measure theory, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis. The theory of stochastic processes is considered to be an important contribution to mathematics and it continues to be an active topic of research for both theoretical reasons and applications.\n\n",

Such a group of people is known as a queue (British usage) or line (American usage), and the people are said to be waiting or standing in a queue or in line, respectively. (In the New York City area, the phrase on line is often used in place of in line.) Occasionally, both the British and American terms are combined to form the term \"queue line\".\nExamples include checking out groceries or other goods that have been collected in a self service shop, in a shop without self-service, at an ATM, at a ticket desk, a city bus, or in a taxi stand.\nQueueing is a phenomenon in a number of fields, and has been extensively analysed in the study of queueing theory. In economics, queueing is seen as one way to ration scarce goods and services.\n\n",

          "summary": "Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models)\nare essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments.\nYet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an\nend-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent\nsystem, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy.\nThus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination\nin an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end\nmanner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches\nthe content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from\nexisting agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation\nexplicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and\ndynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample\nefficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.\nDuring inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential\naction, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance\nto review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.\nExperimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not\nonly improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of\ngeneralist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall\nperformance.",

          "summary": "The ACPBench dataset provides atomic reasoning tasks required for efficient\nplanning. The dataset is aimed at distilling the complex plan generation task\ninto separate atomic reasoning tasks in their easiest possible form, boolean or\nmultiple-choice questions, where the model has to choose the right answer from\nthe provided options. While the aim of ACPBench is to test the simplest form of\nreasoning about action and change, when tasked with planning, a model does not\ntypically have options to choose from and thus the reasoning required for\nplanning dictates an open-ended, generative form for these tasks. To that end,\nwe introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended\nquestions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these\ntasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a\npolicy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of\nvalidating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms\nfor each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a\nvariety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks the\nperformance of even the largest models is still subpar. Our experiments show\nthat no model outperforms another in these tasks and with a few exceptions all\ntested language models score below 65%, indicating that even the current\nfrontier language models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason\nabout planning. In fact, even the so-called reasoning models struggle with\nsolving these reasoning tasks. ACPBench Hard collection is available at the\nfollowing link: https://ibm.github.io/ACPBench",

          "summary": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly\nenhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from\nfast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2).\nWhile System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial\ncomputational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or\nunnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is\ncomputationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it\nis critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and\ncomputational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy.\nIn this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in\nboth the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i)\nthe cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different\nreasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy.\nBy offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to\nshed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby\nserving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. We\nalso provide a public repository to continually track developments in this\nfast-evolving field.",

Particularly the EDE models that fit the acoustic datasets prefer\nlower $\\Omega_m$, higher $H_0$, $n_s$ and $\\sigma_8$ in contrast to the\nlate-time solutions. We discuss the current status and near-future prospects\nfor distinguishing amongst these solutions.",

          "title": "Agent Orange",
          "content": "Agent Orange is a chemical herbicide and defoliant, one of the tactical use Rainbow Herbicides. It was used by the U.S. military as part of its herbicidal warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971. The U.S. was strongly influenced by the British who used Agent Orange during the Malayan Emergency. It is a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D.\nAgent Orange was produced in the United States beginning in the late 1940s and was used in industrial agriculture, and was also sprayed along railroads and power lines to control undergrowth in forests. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. military procured over 20,000,000 U.S. gal (76,000,000 L; 17,000,000 imp gal), consisting of a fifty-fifty mixture of 2,4-D and dioxin-contaminated 2,4,5-T. Nine chemical companies produced it: Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto Company, Diamond Shamrock Corporation, Hercules Inc., Thompson Hayward Chemical Co., United States Rubber Company (Uniroyal), Thompson Chemical Co., Hoffman-Taff Chemicals, Inc., and Agriselect.\nThe government of Vietnam says that up to four million people in Vietnam were exposed to the defoliant, and as many as three million people have suffered illness because of Agent Orange, while the Vietnamese Red Cross estimates that up to one million people were disabled or have health problems as a result of exposure to Agent Orange. While the United States government has described these figures as unreliable, it has documented cases of leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various kinds of cancer in exposed U.S. military veterans. The US Government has not conclusively found either a causal relationship or a plausible biological carcinogenic mechanism for cancers. An epidemiological study done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that there was an increase in the rate of birth defects of the children of military personnel who were exposed to Agent Orange. Agent Orange has also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 ha (7,700,000 acres) or 31,000 km2 (12,000 sq mi) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making reforestation difficult in numerous areas. Animal species diversity is sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas. The environmental destruction caused by this defoliation has been described by Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, lawyers, historians and other academics as an ecocide.\nThe use of Agent Orange in Vietnam resulted in numerous legal actions. The United Nations ratified United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72 and the Environmental Modification Convention. Lawsuits filed on behalf of both U.S. and Vietnamese veterans sought compensation for damages.\nAgent Orange was first used by British Commonwealth forces in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. It was also used by the U.S. military in Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam War because forests near the border with Vietnam were used by the Viet Cong.\n\n",

          "content": "Jonathan Dwight Jones (born July 19, 1987) is an American professional mixed martial artist. He currently competes in the Heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is the current UFC Heavyweight Champion. A professional since 2008, Jones was previously the UFC Light Heavyweight Champion from 2011 to 2015 and from 2018 to 2020, as well as the interim UFC Light Heavyweight Champion in 2016. As of November 19, 2024, he is #2\nin the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings. He is regarded as one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time.\nJones became the youngest champion in UFC history with his title victory over Maur\u00edcio Rua at age 23. He holds many UFC records in the light heavyweight division, including the most title defenses, most wins, and longest win streak. He is also the only fighter ever to beat five former UFC champions consecutively. During much of his championship reign, Jones has been widely considered to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. Never stopped nor outscored during his career, Jones's only professional loss is a controversial disqualification against Matt Hamill; a result disputed by Hamill and UFC president Dana White.\nBetween 2015 and 2017, Jones was involved in several controversies and lost his title three times as a result of disciplinary action. He was first stripped of his title and removed from the official rankings by the UFC in 2015 after he was arrested on felony hit-and-run charges. His subsequent returns to the UFC in 2016 and 2017 saw him emerge victorious in title bouts against Ovince Saint Preux and Daniel Cormier, but were both cut short by Jones testing positive for banned substances and receiving further suspensions, with the latter reversed to a no contest. After his 2017 suspension was lifted, Jones reclaimed the championship in 2018 by defeating Alexander Gustafsson. He voluntarily vacated the title in 2020 and spent three years away from MMA before returning in 2023 to win the UFC Heavyweight Championship against Ciryl Gane, making history as just the eighth UFC fighter to become a two-division champion.",

          "content": "In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent is an entity that perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously to achieve goals, and may improve its performance through machine learning or by acquiring knowledge. Leading AI textbooks define artificial intelligence as the \"study and design of intelligent agents,\" emphasizing that goal-directed behavior is central to intelligence.\nA specialized subset of intelligent agents, agentic AI (also known as an AI agent or simply agent), expands this concept by proactively pursuing goals, making decisions, and taking actions over extended periods, thereby exemplifying a novel form of digital agency.\nIntelligent agents can range from simple to highly complex. A basic thermostat or control system is considered an intelligent agent, as is a human being, or any other system that meets the same criteria\u2014such as a firm, a state, or a biome.\nIntelligent agents operate based on an objective function, which encapsulates their goals. They are designed to create and execute plans that maximize the expected value of this function upon completion. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a reward function, which allows programmers to shape its desired behavior. Similarly, an evolutionary algorithm's behavior is guided by a fitness function.\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations.\nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as abstract functional systems similar to computer programs. To distinguish theoretical models from real-world implementations, abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents\u2014autonomous computer programs that carry out tasks on behalf of users. They are also referred to using a term borrowed from economics: a \"rational agent\".\n\n",

          "title": "Vertigo",
          "content": "Vertigo is a condition in which a person has the sensation that they are moving, or that objects around them are moving, when they are not. Often it feels like a spinning or swaying movement. It may be associated with nausea, vomiting, perspiration, or difficulties walking. It is typically worse when the head is moved. Vertigo is the most common type of dizziness.\nThe most common disorders that result in vertigo are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, and vestibular neuritis. Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the middle ears. Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning with the eyes closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo typically indicates a problem in a part of the vestibular system. Other causes of dizziness include presyncope, disequilibrium, and non-specific dizziness.\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo is more likely in someone who gets repeated episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. Benign vertigo episodes generally last less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as nystagmus in this condition. In M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes. In vestibular neuritis the onset of vertigo is sudden, and the nystagmus occurs even when the person has not been moving. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered, especially if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur.\nDizziness affects approximately 20\u201340% of people at some point in time, while about 7.5\u201310% have vertigo. About 5% have vertigo in a given year. It becomes more common with age and affects women two to three times more often than men. Vertigo accounts for about 2\u20133% of emergency department visits in the developed world.",

          "abstract": "Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been significantly boosted by the development of transformer-based large language models (LLMs). These models have revolutionized NLP tasks, particularly in code generation, aiding developers in creating software with enhanced efficiency. Despite their advances, challenges remain in balancing code snippet generation with effective test case generation and execution. To address these issues, this paper introduces Multiagent-Code Generation (AgentCoder), a novel solution comprising a multi-agent framework with specialized agents: the programmer agent, the test designer agent, and the test executor agent. During the coding procedure, the programmer agent focuses on the code generation and refinement based on the test executor agent\u2019s feedback. The test designer agent generates test cases for the generated code, and the test executor agent runs the code with the test cases and writes feedback to the programmer. This collaborative system ensures more effective code generation, surpassing the limitations of single-agent models and previous strategies. Our extensive experiments on 12 LLMs and 13 optimisation approaches showcase AgentCoder\u2019s superior performance over existing code generation models and prompt engineering techniques across various benchmarks. For example, AgentCoder achieves 77.4% and 89.1% pass@1 in HumanEval-ET and MBPP-ET with GPT-3.5, while state-of-the-art obtains only 69.5% and 63.0%.",

Existing adversarial attacks for MARL could be used for testing, but is limited to one robustness aspects (e.g., reward, state, action), while c-MARL model could be attacked from any aspect. To overcome the challenge, we propose MARLSafe, the first robustness testing framework for c-MARL algorithms. First, motivated by Markov Decision Process (MDP), MARLSafe consider the robustness of c-MARL algorithms comprehensively from three aspects, namely state robustness, action robustness and reward robustness. Any c-MARL algorithm must simultaneously satisfy these robustness aspects to be considered secure. Second, due to the scarceness of c- MARL attack, we propose c-MARL attacks as robustness testing algorithms from multiple aspects. Experiments on SMAC environment reveals that many state-of-the-art c- MARL algorithms are of low robustness in all aspect, pointing out the urgent need to test and enhance robustness of c-MARL algorithms.",

Agents are suitable for testing games, since they are reactive and able to reason about their environment to decide the action they want to take. This paper presents the experience of using an agent-based automated testing framework called iv4xr to test computer games. Three games will be discussed, including a sophisticated 3D game called Space Engineers. We will show how the framework can be used in different ways, either directly to drive a test agent, or as an intelligent functionality that can be driven by a traditional automated testing algorithm such as a random algorithm or a model based testing algorithm.",

To train RIG in an end-to-end\nmanner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches\nthe content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from\nexisting agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation\nexplicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and\ndynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample\nefficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.\nDuring inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential\naction, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance\nto review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.\nExperimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not\nonly improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of\ngeneralist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall\nperformance.",

Existing approaches require time-consuming tuning,\nreferences for all subjects, or access to other creations. We introduce\nContrastive Concept Instantiation (CoCoIns) to effectively synthesize\nconsistent subjects across multiple independent creations. The framework\nconsists of a generative model and a mapping network, which transforms input\nlatent codes into pseudo-words associated with certain instances of concepts.\nUsers can generate consistent subjects with the same latent codes. To construct\nsuch associations, we propose a contrastive learning approach that trains the\nnetwork to differentiate the combination of prompts and latent codes. Extensive\nevaluations of human faces with a single subject show that CoCoIns performs\ncomparably to existing methods while maintaining higher flexibility. We also\ndemonstrate the potential of extending CoCoIns to multiple subjects and other\nobject categories.",

SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level\nhierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task\nscenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable\nground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL\nwith supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and\nsuperior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks,\neven outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like\nLongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual\nperception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We\nidentify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual\ncues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling,\nand RL robustness against noisy signals.",

          "title": "ERUPT: Efficient Rendering with Unposed Patch Transformer",
          "summary": "This work addresses the problem of novel view synthesis in diverse scenes\nfrom small collections of RGB images. We propose ERUPT (Efficient Rendering\nwith Unposed Patch Transformer) a state-of-the-art scene reconstruction model\ncapable of efficient scene rendering using unposed imagery. We introduce\npatch-based querying, in contrast to existing pixel-based queries, to reduce\nthe compute required to render a target view. This makes our model highly\nefficient both during training and at inference, capable of rendering at 600\nfps on commercial hardware. Notably, our model is designed to use a learned\nlatent camera pose which allows for training using unposed targets in datasets\nwith sparse or inaccurate ground truth camera pose. We show that our approach\ncan generalize on large real-world data and introduce a new benchmark dataset\n(MSVS-1M) for latent view synthesis using street-view imagery collected from\nMapillary. In contrast to NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, which require dense\nimagery and precise metadata, ERUPT can render novel views of arbitrary scenes\nwith as few as five unposed input images. ERUPT achieves better rendered image\nquality than current state-of-the-art methods for unposed image synthesis\ntasks, reduces labeled data requirements by ~95\\% and decreases computational\nrequirements by an order of magnitude, providing efficient novel view synthesis\nfor diverse real-world scenes.",

Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.\nStatistics and mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning. \nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.",

Although they do not need to be labeled, high-quality datasets for unsupervised learning can also be difficult and costly to produce.\nMany organizations, including governments, publish and share their datasets. The datasets are classified, based on the licenses, as Open data and Non-Open data.\nThe datasets from various governmental-bodies are presented in List of open government data sites. The datasets are ported on open data portals. They are made available for searching, depositing and accessing through interfaces like Open API.

Artificial neuron models that mimic biological neurons more closely have also been recently investigated and shown to significantly improve performance. These are connected by edges, which model the synapses in the brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons. The \"signal\" is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, called the activation function. The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight, which adjusts during the learning process.\nTypically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly passing through multiple intermediate layers (hidden layers). A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least two hidden layers.\nArtificial neural networks are used for various tasks, including predictive modeling, adaptive control, and solving problems in artificial intelligence. They can learn from experience, and can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.\n\n",

          "content": "Attention is a machine learning method that determines the relative importance of each component in a sequence relative to the other components in that sequence. In natural language processing, importance is represented by \"soft\" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size.\nUnlike \"hard\" weights, which are computed during the backwards training pass, \"soft\" weights exist only in the forward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. Earlier designs implemented the attention mechanism in a serial recurrent neural network (RNN) language translation system, but a more recent design, namely the transformer, removed the slower sequential RNN and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention scheme.\nInspired by ideas about attention in humans, the attention mechanism was developed to address the weaknesses of leveraging information from the hidden layers of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks favor more recent information contained in words at the end of a sentence, while information earlier in the sentence tends to be attenuated. Attention allows a token equal access to any part of a sentence directly, rather than only through the previous state.\n\n",

Text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished.\nTransformers have the advantage of having no recurrent units, therefore requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM). Later variations have been widely adopted for training large language models (LLM) on large (language) datasets.\n\nTransformers were first developed as an improvement over previous architectures for machine translation, but have found many applications since. They are used in large-scale natural language processing, computer vision (vision transformers), reinforcement learning, audio, multimodal learning, robotics, and even playing chess. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers).",

    "report": "# Comprehensive Research Report on Graph Theory\n\n## Introduction\n\nGraph theory is a fundamental area of mathematics and computer science that studies graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. These structures are pivotal in various fields, including network analysis, algorithm design, and data science. The importance of graph theory lies in its ability to provide insights into complex systems and solve problems related to connectivity, optimization, and data organization. This report explores the foundational concepts, applications, and recent advancements in graph theory, drawing from a wide range of sources.\n\n## Fundamental Concepts in Graph Theory\n\n### Definitions and Types of Graphs\n\nA graph consists of vertices (or nodes) and edges (or links) that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs can be classified into two main types: undirected and directed graphs. In undirected graphs, edges connect vertices symmetrically, whereas in directed graphs, edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship [Document 2, Document 5].\n\n### Historical Context\n\nThe term \"graph\" in this context was first introduced by J. J. Sylvester in 1878, highlighting the connection between mathematics and chemical structures [research-4]. This historical perspective underscores the interdisciplinary nature of graph theory.\n\n## Applications of Graph Theory\n\n### Network Analysis\n\nGraph theory is extensively used in network analysis, where it helps model and analyze the structure of networks. Tools like NetworkX in Python facilitate the application of graph theory to real-world problems, such as social network analysis and biological network modeling [research-19].\n\n### Optimization Problems\n\nGraph theory provides frameworks for solving optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path, maximum flow, and minimum spanning tree. Recent advancements include algorithms for multi-commodity flow problems on directed graphs, which have applications in logistics and telecommunications [Document 20, Document 21].\n\n### Visualization and Interactive Tools\n\nInteractive visualization tools, such as those developed using D3.js and Cytoscape.js, enhance the understanding of graph structures and algorithms. These tools are crucial for educational purposes and for professionals working with complex data sets [Document 16, Document 18].\n\n## Advanced Topics in Graph Theory\n\n### Algebraic and Spectral Graph Theory\n\nAlgebraic graph theory explores the relationship between graph properties and algebraic structures, while spectral graph theory examines the eigenvalues of matrices associated with graphs to derive combinatorial properties. These areas are expanding rapidly and offer deep insights into graph behavior [Document 12, Document 15].\n\n### Matching and Network Flow\n\nMatching in graph theory involves finding a set of edges without common vertices, which is essential in resource allocation problems. This concept is closely related to network flow problems, where the goal is to optimize the flow of resources through a network [research-9].\n\n## Recent Developments and Trends\n\n### Computational Advances\n\nRecent research has focused on developing faster algorithms for graph-related problems, leveraging advances in computational power and optimization techniques. These developments are crucial for handling large-scale graphs in real-time applications [research-20].\n\n### Interdisciplinary Applications\n\nGraph theory continues to find new applications across disciplines, from chemistry and biology to computer science and social sciences. This trend highlights the versatility and adaptability of graph-theoretical approaches [Document 4, Document 19].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGraph theory is a dynamic and essential field of study with wide-ranging applications and ongoing research developments. Its ability to model complex relationships and solve intricate problems makes it invaluable in both theoretical and applied contexts. As computational capabilities expand, graph theory will continue to evolve, offering new insights and solutions across various domains.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n### Research Sources\n\n[research-19] **Source document**.

          "summary": "We use a Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) model to constrain the\nevolution of low-redshift $(z\\lesssim0.4)$ matter fluctuations by\ncross-correlating DESI Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) legacy imaging with the\nlatest CMB lensing maps from Planck and ACT. Our tomographic BGS analysis finds\nthat the evolution and amplitude of matter fluctuations align with\nCMB-conditioned $\\Lambda$CDM predictions. When including DESI Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) measurements we obtain $\\sigma_8 = 0.876^{+0.051}_{-0.067}$\nfrom BGS alone. Jointly analyzing BGS and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG)\ncross-correlations with the same CMB lensing maps yields $\\sigma_8 =\n0.791\\pm0.021$. As a complementary approach we isolate the galaxy magnification\nsignal from the cross-correlation of non-overlapping BGS and LRG photometric\nredshift bins, ruling out the null-magnification hypothesis at $11\\sigma$. For\nthe first time, we constrain structure growth from the (finite-difference\ncalibrated) galaxy magnification signal and find\n$\\sigma_8=0.720\\pm0.047\\,\\,({\\rm stat.})\\pm0.050\\,\\,({\\rm sys.})$ when adopting\na linear bias model and including BAO data.",

          "summary": "The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the\nextended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental\nphases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The\nquantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are\nless understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have\nbeen separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a\nunified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the\nrealizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility\nedges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct\nphases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we\nshow that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry\npreserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a\ncriteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with\nmobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical\nstates that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized\nincommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a\nnovel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless\nsystems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact\nsolvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we\nidentify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system\nhosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single\nmodel that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization.\nFinally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using\nquasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.",

As a result, we obtain the first\nalmost-linear time algorithm that solves $\\ell_{q, p}$ flows on directed graphs\nto high accuracy. Second, we present optimization tools to reduce approximately\nsolving composite $\\ell_{1, \\infty}$-regression problems to solving\n$m^{o(1)}\\epsilon^{-1}$ instances of composite $\\ell_{q, p}$-regression\nproblem.

The objects are represented by abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line). Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.\nThe edges may be directed or undirected. For example, if the vertices represent people at a party, and there is an edge between two people if they shake hands, then this graph is undirected because any person A can shake hands with a person B only if B also shakes hands with A. In contrast, if an edge from a person A to a person B means that A owes money to B, then this graph is directed, because owing money is not necessarily reciprocated.\nGraphs are the basic subject studied by graph theory. The word \"graph\" was first used in this sense by J. J. Sylvester in 1878 due to a direct relation between mathematics and chemical structure (what he called a chemico-graphical image).\n\n",

The objects are represented by abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line). Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.\nThe edges may be directed or undirected. For example, if the vertices represent people at a party, and there is an edge between two people if they shake hands, then this graph is undirected because any person A can shake hands with a person B only if B also shakes hands with A. In contrast, if an edge from a person A to a person B means that A owes money to B, then this graph is directed, because owing money is not necessarily reciprocated.",

    "report": "# Comprehensive Research Report on Computer Vision\n\n## Introduction\n\nComputer vision is a rapidly evolving field that plays a crucial role in the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. It involves the acquisition, processing, analysis, and understanding of digital images to extract meaningful information. This capability is essential for various applications, including autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, industrial inspection, and more. The importance of computer vision lies in its ability to transform visual data into actionable insights, enabling machines to interpret and interact with the world in a human-like manner.\n\n## Theoretical Foundations of Computer Vision\n\n### Image Acquisition and Processing\n\nComputer vision systems begin with the acquisition of image data, which can take multiple forms such as video sequences, 3D point clouds, and medical scans [research-2]. The processing of these images involves techniques to enhance and prepare the data for further analysis. This stage is critical for ensuring that the subsequent steps in the computer vision pipeline can be executed effectively.\n\n### Image Analysis and Understanding\n\nThe core of computer vision lies in the analysis and understanding of images. This involves extracting high-dimensional data and transforming it into numerical or symbolic information [research-1]. The process of image understanding is akin to the human brain's ability to interpret visual stimuli, involving complex models based on geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.\n\n## Applications of Computer Vision\n\n### Industrial and Medical Applications\n\nAccurate 3D imaging is vital in fields such as industrial inspection and medical imaging. For instance, the ability to capture detailed images of specular surfaces is crucial for quality control in manufacturing and for diagnostic purposes in healthcare [research-3]. These applications demonstrate the practical significance of computer vision in enhancing precision and efficiency.\n\n### Open Source Contributions\n\nThe development of computer vision technologies is significantly supported by open-source projects.

          "abstract": "There are two major types of uncertainty one can model. Aleatoric uncertainty captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model - uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.",

          "abstract": "Convolutional networks are at the core of most state of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21:2% top-1 and 5:6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3:5% top-5 error and 17:3% top-1 error on the validation set and 3:6% top-5 error on the official test set.",

They are crucial for developing software that is both efficient and scalable, impacting various fields such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, and data analysis. Understanding these concepts is vital for computer scientists and engineers as they design systems that can handle large volumes of data and perform complex calculations quickly.\n\n## Key Concepts in Data Structures\n\n### Types of Data Structures\n\nData structures can be broadly categorized into linear and non-linear structures:\n\n- **Linear Data Structures**: These include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. They store data in a sequential manner, making them suitable for scenarios where data is processed in a linear order.\n- **Non-linear Data Structures**: These include trees and graphs, which allow for more complex relationships between data elements. They are essential for representing hierarchical data and networks.\n\n### Importance of Data Structures\n\nEfficient data structures are critical for optimizing the performance of algorithms. For instance, choosing the right data structure can significantly reduce the time complexity of an algorithm, leading to faster execution times and reduced resource consumption. This is particularly important in fields like computer vision, where large datasets are processed to extract meaningful information [Document 1, Document 2].\n\n## Algorithms: The Heart of Problem Solving\n\n### Types of Algorithms\n\nAlgorithms can be classified based on their design paradigms:\n\n- **Divide and Conquer**: This approach breaks a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves each sub-problem independently, and combines their solutions to solve the original problem. Examples include merge sort and quicksort.\n- **Dynamic Programming**: This technique solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems and storing the results of these sub-problems to avoid redundant computations. It is widely used in optimization problems.\n- **Greedy Algorithms**: These algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are used in problems like the knapsack problem and graph algorithms.\n\n### Algorithm Efficiency\n\nThe efficiency of an algorithm is measured in terms of time and space complexity. An efficient algorithm minimizes the resources required to solve a problem, which is crucial in applications like computer vision and data analysis, where large datasets are common [research-18].\n\n## Applications in Computer Vision\n\nComputer vision is a field that heavily relies on data structures and algorithms to process and analyze visual data. Tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and 3D reconstruction require efficient algorithms to handle the vast amounts of data generated by cameras and sensors [Document 14, Document 18].\n\n### Challenges and Solutions\n\nOne of the main challenges in computer vision is the need to process high-dimensional data efficiently. Advanced data structures and algorithms are employed to extract meaningful information from images and videos, enabling applications in areas like autonomous vehicles and medical imaging [Document 2, Document 14].\n\n## Trends and Insights\n\nRecent advancements in data structures and algorithms have been driven by the need to process larger datasets and perform more complex computations. The development of hybrid models and frameworks, such as those used in computer vision, demonstrates the ongoing evolution of these concepts to meet the demands of modern applications [Document 7, Document 9].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nData structures and algorithms are fundamental to the field of computer science, providing the tools necessary for efficient data processing and problem-solving. Their importance is underscored by their application in diverse fields, from computer vision to data analysis. As technology continues to advance, the development of more sophisticated data structures and algorithms will be essential to meet the growing demands of computational tasks.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n### Research Sources\n\n[research-18] **Source document**.

          "summary": "Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point\nclouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network\narchitectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast,\nthe limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major\nbottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has\ndriven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video\ndata with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this\nwork, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient\ntraining-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention\nadaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training\nor network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently\nencode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully\ndisentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region\nsegmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction.\nExtensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our\nlightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic\ndatasets.

Its\nsurface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density\nwave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we\npropose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface\nand in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual\nfeatures detected by surface probes in this material. Through a\nphenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental\nsignatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of\nCDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii)\nthe magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the\nCDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature\nand its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental\nchecks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.",

In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. The node at the \"top\" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.\nThe heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact, priority queues are often referred to as \"heaps\", regardless of how they may be implemented. In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. However, a heap is not a sorted structure; it can be regarded as being partially ordered. A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority, or when insertions need to be interspersed with removals of the root node.\nA common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree (see figure). The heap data structure, specifically the binary heap, was introduced by J. W. J. Williams in 1964, as a data structure for the heapsort sorting algorithm. Heaps are also crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm. When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has the smallest possible height\u2014a heap with N nodes and a branches for each node always has loga N height.\nNote that, as shown in the graphic, there is no implied ordering between siblings or cousins and no implied sequence for an in-order traversal (as there would be in, e.g., a binary search tree). The heap relation mentioned above applies only between nodes and their parents, grandparents. The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap.\nHeaps are typically constructed in-place in the same array where the elements are stored, with their structure being implicit in the access pattern of the operations.  Heaps differ in this way from other data structures with similar or in some cases better theoretic bounds such as radix trees in that they require no additional memory beyond that used for storing the keys.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we present Majority-Inverter Graph (MIG), a novel logic representation structure for efficient optimization of Boolean functions. An MIG is a directed acyclic graph consisting of three-input majority nodes and regular/complemented edges. We show that MIGs include any AND/OR/Inverter Graphs (AOIGs), containing also the wellknown AIGs. In order to support the natural manipulation of MIGs, we introduce a new Boolean algebra, based exclusively on majority and inverter operations, with a complete axiomatic system. Theoretical results show that it is possible to explore the entire MIG representation space by using only five primitive transformation rules. Such feature opens up a great opportunity for logic optimization and synthesis. We showcase the MIG potential by proposing a delay-oriented optimization technique. Experimental results over MCNC benchmarks show that MIG optimization reduces the number of logic levels by 18%, on average, with respect to AIG optimization performed by ABC academic tool. Employed in a traditional optimization-mapping circuit synthesis flow, MIG optimization enables an average reduction of {22%, 14%, 11%} in the estimated {delay, area, power} metrics, before physical design, as compared to academic/commercial synthesis flows.",

            "summary": "Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point\nclouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network\narchitectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast,\nthe limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major\nbottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has\ndriven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video\ndata with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this\nwork, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient\ntraining-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention\nadaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training\nor network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently\nencode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully\ndisentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region\nsegmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction.\nExtensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our\nlightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic\ndatasets. Our code is publicly available for research purpose at\nhttps://easi3r.github.io/",

            "summary": "UTe$_2$ has been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies\nin recent years, as it is recognized as an odd-parity bulk superconductor. Its\nsurface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density\nwave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we\npropose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface\nand in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual\nfeatures detected by surface probes in this material. Through a\nphenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental\nsignatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of\nCDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii)\nthe magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the\nCDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature\nand its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental\nchecks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.",

To train RIG in an end-to-end\nmanner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches\nthe content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from\nexisting agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation\nexplicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and\ndynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample\nefficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.\nDuring inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential\naction, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance\nto review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.\nExperimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not\nonly improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of\ngeneralist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall\nperformance.",

            "summary": "Underwater object detection is critical for oceanic research and industrial\nsafety inspections. However, the complex optical environment and the limited\nresources of underwater equipment pose significant challenges to achieving high\naccuracy and low power consumption. To address these issues, we propose Spiking\nUnderwater YOLO (SU-YOLO), a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model. Leveraging the\nlightweight and energy-efficient properties of SNNs, SU-YOLO incorporates a\nnovel spike-based underwater image denoising method based solely on integer\naddition, which enhances the quality of feature maps with minimal computational\noverhead. In addition, we introduce Separated Batch Normalization (SeBN), a\ntechnique that normalizes feature maps independently across multiple time steps\nand is optimized for integration with residual structures to capture the\ntemporal dynamics of SNNs more effectively. The redesigned spiking residual\nblocks integrate the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with the YOLO\narchitecture to mitigate spike degradation and enhance the model's feature\nextraction capabilities. Experimental results on URPC2019 underwater dataset\ndemonstrate that SU-YOLO achieves mAP of 78.8% with 6.97M parameters and an\nenergy consumption of 2.98 mJ, surpassing mainstream SNN models in both\ndetection accuracy and computational efficiency. These results underscore the\npotential of SNNs for engineering applications. The code is available in\nhttps://github.com/lwxfight/snn-underwater.",

Existing approaches require time-consuming tuning,\nreferences for all subjects, or access to other creations. We introduce\nContrastive Concept Instantiation (CoCoIns) to effectively synthesize\nconsistent subjects across multiple independent creations. The framework\nconsists of a generative model and a mapping network, which transforms input\nlatent codes into pseudo-words associated with certain instances of concepts.\nUsers can generate consistent subjects with the same latent codes. To construct\nsuch associations, we propose a contrastive learning approach that trains the\nnetwork to differentiate the combination of prompts and latent codes. Extensive\nevaluations of human faces with a single subject show that CoCoIns performs\ncomparably to existing methods while maintaining higher flexibility. We also\ndemonstrate the potential of extending CoCoIns to multiple subjects and other\nobject categories.",

            "title": "Heap (data structure)",
            "content": "In computer science, a heap is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is the parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. The node at the \"top\" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.\nThe heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact, priority queues are often referred to as \"heaps\", regardless of how they may be implemented. In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. However, a heap is not a sorted structure; it can be regarded as being partially ordered. A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority, or when insertions need to be interspersed with removals of the root node.\nA common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree (see figure). The heap data structure, specifically the binary heap, was introduced by J. W. J. Williams in 1964, as a data structure for the heapsort sorting algorithm. Heaps are also crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm. When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has the smallest possible height\u2014a heap with N nodes and a branches for each node always has loga N height.\nNote that, as shown in the graphic, there is no implied ordering between siblings or cousins and no implied sequence for an in-order traversal (as there would be in, e.g., a binary search tree). The heap relation mentioned above applies only between nodes and their parents, grandparents. The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap.\nHeaps are typically constructed in-place in the same array where the elements are stored, with their structure being implicit in the access pattern of the operations.  Heaps differ in this way from other data structures with similar or in some cases better theoretic bounds such as radix trees in that they require no additional memory beyond that used for storing the keys.",

In contrast,\\nthe limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major\\nbottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has\\ndriven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video\\ndata with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this\\nwork, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient\\ntraining-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention\\nadaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training\\nor network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently\\nencode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully\\ndisentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region\\nsegmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction.\\nExtensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our\\nlightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous\\nstate-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic\\ndatasets.

In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. The node at the \"top\" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.\nThe heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact, priority queues are often referred to as \"heaps\", regardless of how they may be implemented. In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. However, a heap is not a sorted structure; it can be regarded as being partially ordered. A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority, or when insertions need to be interspersed with removals of the root node.",

Heaps are also crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm. When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has the smallest possible height\u2014a heap with N nodes and a branches for each node always has loga N height.\nNote that, as shown in the graphic, there is no implied ordering between siblings or cousins and no implied sequence for an in-order traversal (as there would be in, e.g., a binary search tree). The heap relation mentioned above applies only between nodes and their parents, grandparents. The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap.",

            "summary": "Recent advances in DUSt3R have enabled robust estimation of dense point\nclouds and camera parameters of static scenes, leveraging Transformer network\narchitectures and direct supervision on large-scale 3D datasets. In contrast,\nthe limited scale and diversity of available 4D datasets present a major\nbottleneck for training a highly generalizable 4D model. This constraint has\ndriven conventional 4D methods to fine-tune 3D models on scalable dynamic video\ndata with additional geometric priors such as optical flow and depths. In this\nwork, we take an opposite path and introduce Easi3R, a simple yet efficient\ntraining-free method for 4D reconstruction. Our approach applies attention\nadaptation during inference, eliminating the need for from-scratch pre-training\nor network fine-tuning. We find that the attention layers in DUSt3R inherently\nencode rich information about camera and object motion. By carefully\ndisentangling these attention maps, we achieve accurate dynamic region\nsegmentation, camera pose estimation, and 4D dense point map reconstruction.\nExtensive experiments on real-world dynamic videos demonstrate that our\nlightweight attention adaptation significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods that are trained or finetuned on extensive dynamic\ndatasets. Our code is publicly available for research purpose at\nhttps://easi3r.github.io/",

            "summary": "UTe$_2$ has been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies\nin recent years, as it is recognized as an odd-parity bulk superconductor. Its\nsurface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density\nwave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we\npropose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface\nand in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual\nfeatures detected by surface probes in this material. Through a\nphenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental\nsignatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of\nCDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii)\nthe magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the\nCDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature\nand its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental\nchecks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.",

            "summary": "Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models)\nare essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments.\nYet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an\nend-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent\nsystem, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy.\nThus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination\nin an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end\nmanner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches\nthe content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from\nexisting agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation\nexplicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and\ndynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample\nefficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.\nDuring inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential\naction, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance\nto review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.\nExperimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not\nonly improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of\ngeneralist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall\nperformance.",

            "summary": "Underwater object detection is critical for oceanic research and industrial\nsafety inspections. However, the complex optical environment and the limited\nresources of underwater equipment pose significant challenges to achieving high\naccuracy and low power consumption. To address these issues, we propose Spiking\nUnderwater YOLO (SU-YOLO), a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model. Leveraging the\nlightweight and energy-efficient properties of SNNs, SU-YOLO incorporates a\nnovel spike-based underwater image denoising method based solely on integer\naddition, which enhances the quality of feature maps with minimal computational\noverhead. In addition, we introduce Separated Batch Normalization (SeBN), a\ntechnique that normalizes feature maps independently across multiple time steps\nand is optimized for integration with residual structures to capture the\ntemporal dynamics of SNNs more effectively. The redesigned spiking residual\nblocks integrate the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with the YOLO\narchitecture to mitigate spike degradation and enhance the model's feature\nextraction capabilities. Experimental results on URPC2019 underwater dataset\ndemonstrate that SU-YOLO achieves mAP of 78.8% with 6.97M parameters and an\nenergy consumption of 2.98 mJ, surpassing mainstream SNN models in both\ndetection accuracy and computational efficiency. These results underscore the\npotential of SNNs for engineering applications. The code is available in\nhttps://github.com/lwxfight/snn-underwater.",

Existing approaches require time-consuming tuning,\nreferences for all subjects, or access to other creations. We introduce\nContrastive Concept Instantiation (CoCoIns) to effectively synthesize\nconsistent subjects across multiple independent creations. The framework\nconsists of a generative model and a mapping network, which transforms input\nlatent codes into pseudo-words associated with certain instances of concepts.\nUsers can generate consistent subjects with the same latent codes. To construct\nsuch associations, we propose a contrastive learning approach that trains the\nnetwork to differentiate the combination of prompts and latent codes. Extensive\nevaluations of human faces with a single subject show that CoCoIns performs\ncomparably to existing methods while maintaining higher flexibility. We also\ndemonstrate the potential of extending CoCoIns to multiple subjects and other\nobject categories.",

In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. The node at the \"top\" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.\nThe heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact, priority queues are often referred to as \"heaps\", regardless of how they may be implemented. In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. However, a heap is not a sorted structure; it can be regarded as being partially ordered. A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority, or when insertions need to be interspersed with removals of the root node.\nA common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree (see figure). The heap data structure, specifically the binary heap, was introduced by J. W. J. Williams in 1964, as a data structure for the heapsort sorting algorithm. Heaps are also crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm. When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has the smallest possible height\u2014a heap with N nodes and a branches for each node always has loga N height.\nNote that, as shown in the graphic, there is no implied ordering between siblings or cousins and no implied sequence for an in-order traversal (as there would be in, e.g., a binary search tree). The heap relation mentioned above applies only between nodes and their parents, grandparents. The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap.\nHeaps are typically constructed in-place in the same array where the elements are stored, with their structure being implicit in the access pattern of the operations.  Heaps differ in this way from other data structures with similar or in some cases better theoretic bounds such as radix trees in that they require no additional memory beyond that used for storing the keys.",

An MIG is a directed acyclic graph consisting of three-input majority nodes and regular/complemented edges. We show that MIGs include any AND/OR/Inverter Graphs (AOIGs), containing also the wellknown AIGs. In order to support the natural manipulation of MIGs, we introduce a new Boolean algebra, based exclusively on majority and inverter operations, with a complete axiomatic system. Theoretical results show that it is possible to explore the entire MIG representation space by using only five primitive transformation rules. Such feature opens up a great opportunity for logic optimization and synthesis. We showcase the MIG potential by proposing a delay-oriented optimization technique. Experimental results over MCNC benchmarks show that MIG optimization reduces the number of logic levels by 18%, on average, with respect to AIG optimization performed by ABC academic tool. Employed in a traditional optimization-mapping circuit synthesis flow, MIG optimization enables an average reduction of {22%, 14%, 11%} in the estimated {delay, area, power} metrics, before physical design, as compared to academic/commercial synthesis flows.",

            "abstract": "In phylogenomics the analysis of concatenated gene alignments, the so-called supermatrix, is commonly accompanied by the assumption of partition models. Under such models each gene, or more generally partition, is allowed to evolve under its own evolutionary model. Although partition models provide a more comprehensive analysis of supermatrices, missing data may hamper the tree search algorithms due to the existence of phylogenetic (partial) terraces. Here, we introduce the phylogenetic terrace aware (PTA) data structure for the efficient analysis under partition models. In the presence of missing data PTA exploits (partial) terraces and induced partition trees to save computation time. We show that an implementation of PTA in IQ-TREE leads to a substantial speedup of up to 4.5 and 8 times compared with the standard IQ-TREE and RAxML implementations, respectively. PTA is generally applicable to all types of partition models and common topological rearrangements thus can be employed by all phylogenomic inference software.",

In addition, other more practically oriented, areas of computer science\u2014 such as computer graphics, computer-aided design, robotics, pattern recognition, and operations research\u2014give rise to problems that inherently are geometrical. This is one reason computational geometry has attracted enormous research interest in the past decade and is a well-established area today. (For standard sources, we refer to the survey article by Lee and Preparata [19841 and to the textbooks by Preparata and Shames [1985] and Edelsbrunner [1987bl.) Readers familiar with the literature of computational geometry will have noticed, especially in the last few years, an increasing interest in a geometrical construct called the Voronoi diagram. This trend can also be observed in combinatorial geometry and in a considerable number of articles in natural science journals that address the Voronoi diagram under different names specific to the respective area. Given some number of points in the plane, their Voronoi diagram divides the plane according to the nearest-neighbor",

In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. The node at the \"top\" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.\nThe heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact, priority queues are often referred to as \"heaps\", regardless of how they may be implemented. In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root. However, a heap is not a sorted structure; it can be regarded as being partially ordered. A heap is a useful data structure when it is necessary to repeatedly remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority, or when insertions need to be interspersed with removals of the root node.",

Heaps are also crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm. When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has the smallest possible height\u2014a heap with N nodes and a branches for each node always has loga N height.\nNote that, as shown in the graphic, there is no implied ordering between siblings or cousins and no implied sequence for an in-order traversal (as there would be in, e.g., a binary search tree).

An MIG is a directed acyclic graph consisting of three-input majority nodes and regular/complemented edges. We show that MIGs include any AND/OR/Inverter Graphs (AOIGs), containing also the wellknown AIGs. In order to support the natural manipulation of MIGs, we introduce a new Boolean algebra, based exclusively on majority and inverter operations, with a complete axiomatic system. Theoretical results show that it is possible to explore the entire MIG representation space by using only five primitive transformation rules. Such feature opens up a great opportunity for logic optimization and synthesis. We showcase the MIG potential by proposing a delay-oriented optimization technique. Experimental results over MCNC benchmarks show that MIG optimization reduces the number of logic levels by 18%, on average, with respect to AIG optimization performed by ABC academic tool. Employed in a traditional optimization-mapping circuit synthesis flow, MIG optimization enables an average reduction of {22%, 14%, 11%} in the estimated {delay, area, power} metrics, before physical design, as compared to academic/commercial synthesis flows.', 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/86215b3ff27568432ed467f442c18972b1385ac1',",

Under such models each gene, or more generally partition, is allowed to evolve under its own evolutionary model. Although partition models provide a more comprehensive analysis of supermatrices, missing data may hamper the tree search algorithms due to the existence of phylogenetic (partial) terraces. Here, we introduce the phylogenetic terrace aware (PTA) data structure for the efficient analysis under partition models. In the presence of missing data PTA exploits (partial) terraces and induced partition trees to save computation time. We show that an implementation of PTA in IQ-TREE leads to a substantial speedup of up to 4.5 and 8 times compared with the standard IQ-TREE and RAxML implementations, respectively. PTA is generally applicable to all types of partition models and common topological rearrangements thus can be employed by all phylogenomic inference software.', 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f719586024dffd0d5eb8c21cf8caaa9f5586765', 'venue': 'Systematic Biology', 'year': 2016, 'authors': ['O.
